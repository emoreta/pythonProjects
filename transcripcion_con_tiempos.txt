[342.24s - 346.28s]:  His 25 seconds of presentation begin now.
[346.32s - 353.56s]:  The horror movie we are living is not only the responsibility of the current president or of the corrective system.
[353.56s - 356.20s]:  It is the responsibility of all of us.
[356.20s - 357.56s]:  But not anymore.
[357.56s - 362.04s]:  From today, we choose not the lesser evil.

[380.44s - 383.84s]:  Today we are living the worst moment in the country.
[383.84s - 389.52s]:  Those who have taught us to hate us and are stealing our future have cornered us.
[389.52s - 391.12s]:  But not everything is lost.
[391.12s - 392.60s]:  There is still hope.
[392.60s - 398.72s]:  On February 9, we not only chose president, but also if we stayed or left.
[398.72s - 401.44s]:  I am Jimmy Jairala and I want to be your president.
[403.60s - 405.80s]:  Let's go now with candidate Francesco Tabaki.
[405.80s - 408.96s]:  His 25 seconds start now.
[410.24s - 412.12s]:  While politicians fight,
[412.12s - 413.72s]:  vaccine operators operate,
[413.72s - 415.40s]:  businesses are shut down,
[415.40s - 417.72s]:  citizens are not defended.
[417.72s - 421.36s]:  That's why we have to do things together, quickly and now.
[421.36s - 423.96s]:  I am Francesco Tabaki, List 21.
[423.96s - 427.72s]:  I want to be president to return you peace and hope.

[453.36s - 454.92s]:  It moves me.
[454.92s - 458.28s]:  It could be any of my students in Guayaquil.
[458.28s - 460.48s]:  This will never be more.
[460.48s - 462.92s]:  We will turn pain into hope.
[462.92s - 464.88s]:  We will transform Ecuador.
[464.88s - 466.48s]:  Your time is up Daniel.

[478.72s - 480.68s]:  I am a nuclear engineer.
[480.68s - 483.60s]:  I know how to manage and solve complex problems.
[483.60s - 485.16s]:  We are living a serious crisis.
[485.16s - 489.60s]:  With me we will achieve security, employment and money in your pocket now.
[489.60s - 491.16s]:  This will never be more.
[491.16s - 493.64s]:  I am here because first of all, it is your family.
[493.64s - 495.88s]:  With God in our hands, we are one Ecuador.
[495.88s - 497.72s]:  The Ecuador that we all want.
[499.24s - 500.52s]:  Thank you candidate Kronfle.
[500.52s - 506.32s]:  Candidate Luis Felipe Tilleria, 25 seconds for your presentation from now on.
[506.32s - 507.68s]:  God bless you.
[507.68s - 509.84s]:  I am a migrant like many compatriots.
[509.84s - 514.40s]:  I started cleaning offices and became the manager of one of the world's main banks.
[514.40s - 517.92s]:  Also the first Latin American to be elected councilman of London.
[517.92s - 520.76s]:  I already migrated, I already suffered, but I came back.
[520.76s - 524.88s]:  So that you do not have to migrate, I come to reset the system.
[524.88s - 529.08s]:  Embracing the ideas of freedom, we are going to head for Ecuador to the first world.
[531.08s - 533.52s]:  Candidate Juan Ivan Cueva, please present yourself.
[533.52s - 535.64s]:  25 seconds now.
[535.64s - 537.52s]:  We will stop being anonymous.
[537.52s - 539.88s]:  We will never be invisible again.
[539.88s - 541.08s]:  I am Juan Ivan Cueva.
[541.08s - 545.08s]:  A citizen like you, with a family that I deeply love.
[545.24s - 548.72s]:  I stopped being a spectator and entered politics at 39 years old.
[548.72s - 552.72s]:  I am an engineer, an expert in technologies and renewable energies.
[552.72s - 554.36s]:  I am Juan Ivan Cueva, your friend.
[554.36s - 555.36s]:  List 16.
[557.36s - 558.36s]:  Thank you candidate.
[558.36s - 563.36s]:  Candidate Daniel Novoa Singh, your presentation of 25 seconds from now on.
[565.36s - 566.36s]:  Good evening Ecuador.
[566.36s - 570.20s]:  I am here fulfilling my duty to work with you so that the past does not return.
[570.32s - 579.32s]:  We will review the facts in www.elnodecuador.es and www.elviejoecuador.es.
[579.32s - 583.32s]:  Who are the liars and who are heading to Ecuador for progress.
[583.32s - 584.32s]:  Thank you very much.
[584.32s - 591.32s]:  Once this presentation is concluded, we previously informed that as established the debate rule,
[591.32s - 596.32s]:  only in the cases that correspond to Article 20, which is shown on the screen, the moderators,
[596.44s - 602.44s]:  that is, Fabrizio and I, we can interrupt the candidates for a period of up to 10 seconds,
[602.44s - 609.44s]:  as long as the answer of the candidate is removed from the development theme or
[609.44s - 613.44s]:  does not comply with the good practices established for this presidential debate.
[613.44s - 618.44s]:  The interruption will not be discounted from the time of the candidate's intervention.
[618.44s - 622.44s]:  We then start the development of the first issue, security and prevention of crime.
[622.56s - 627.56s]:  According to the previous draw, the first to intervene will be candidate Henrico Calón,
[627.56s - 632.56s]:  who will have 90 seconds to answer the general question that has been elaborated by the National
[632.56s - 634.56s]:  Debate Committee.
[634.56s - 639.56s]:  That question was delivered to us moderators in closed envelope at 17 o'clock.
[639.56s - 644.56s]:  Here we have candidates in the envelope, the envelope is closed and sealed,
[644.56s - 649.56s]:  and with the headline of the notary who gave the facts of this exercise of transparency.
[649.68s - 654.68s]:  We will proceed to extract the question of the first issue, security and prevention of crime.
[658.68s - 664.68s]:  Candidate Henrico Calón Camacho, minors today are recruited by the organized crime
[664.68s - 667.68s]:  for their illegal acts and businesses.
[667.68s - 675.68s]:  Do you agree that minors for serious crimes are judged as adults?
[675.80s - 679.80s]:  He has 90 seconds to answer, the time runs now.
[679.80s - 685.80s]:  I am going to help our young people by putting the state at their service, education, health
[685.80s - 687.80s]:  and their own security.
[687.80s - 693.80s]:  But to the recruiters of minors who use them as cannon fodder, listen to me well,
[693.80s - 696.80s]:  you bastards, I appreciate your heads.
[696.80s - 702.80s]:  And unfortunately to the minors who have fallen in issues such as the hit or
[702.92s - 708.92s]:  crimes against life, I am in favor of them being judged, that they be lifted the penalties
[708.92s - 712.92s]:  and that when they turn 18 they go to an adult prison.
[712.92s - 716.92s]:  Yes, that is true, we must see everything in a whole.
[716.92s - 721.92s]:  I propose a radical change in the matter of security, both in the preventive part
[721.92s - 726.92s]:  and in the aspect of cooperation of hemispheric character with intelligence,
[726.92s - 731.92s]:  with technology and attacking criminal finances, which is the most important thing.
[732.04s - 738.04s]:  It cannot be that today there are 2000 complaints for monthly extortion.
[738.04s - 744.04s]:  I propose a special unit of action against extortion, the best unit with members of
[744.04s - 751.04s]:  the elite army and the police to prevent this crime that is tormenting the Ecuadorians.
[751.04s - 756.04s]:  With me, the young people will have an opportunity, yes, but I cannot let it go too far
[756.04s - 761.04s]:  that today they are victims of the issue of the hit and I have to protect the life of
[761.16s - 763.16s]:  all the Ecuadorians.
[763.16s - 768.16s]:  Thank you candidate Cucalon and according to the previous draw, the first interpellation
[768.16s - 774.16s]:  to your answer will be performed by candidate Juan Guiaban Cueva in 15 seconds.
[774.16s - 779.16s]:  Candidate Cueva, your 15 seconds to interpret candidate Cucalon run from this moment.
[779.16s - 783.16s]:  Henry, the vice president has a very important role.
[783.16s - 789.16s]:  Do you want to get her out of the country or choose the one that calces you, as Daniel did,
[789.28s - 793.28s]:  and keep her inside so that she can help you with security issues?
[793.28s - 797.28s]:  Candidate Cucalon, let's close the time, I give you, obviously you have to run the time
[797.28s - 800.28s]:  of the 30 seconds you have to intervene.
[800.28s - 804.28s]:  From this moment, candidate Cucalon, to respond to the interpellation, you have 30 seconds,
[804.28s - 805.28s]:  run the time now.
[805.28s - 806.28s]:  Absolutely, Iván.
[806.28s - 812.28s]:  Carla Larrea will be an excellent vice president of the republic, intelligent, capable and
[812.28s - 813.28s]:  brave woman.
[813.28s - 818.28s]:  She will be in all the state issues, because if I have appointed her to be vice president
[818.40s - 821.40s]:  she can be president of Ecuador.
[821.40s - 826.40s]:  Additionally, she will be in charge of productivity and entrepreneurship.
[826.40s - 831.40s]:  And in the social, which will be our seal, she will be in all the decisions.
[831.40s - 833.40s]:  Thank you candidate Cucalon.
[833.40s - 838.40s]:  I want to remind the 8 candidates, the interpellation has to be about the topic that we are
[838.40s - 843.40s]:  addressing and about the question whose answer is answered by the candidate.
[843.40s - 847.40s]:  I want to ask you, comedically, that we take care of this logic.
[847.52s - 852.52s]:  And as you could see before the beginning of this program, the notary gave the envelopes
[852.52s - 857.52s]:  to the candidates who selected randomly their envelopes and placed them in the amphora located
[857.52s - 859.52s]:  on one side of their atrilles.
[859.52s - 863.52s]:  These envelopes will be opened for the development of the second interpellation of the first
[863.52s - 864.52s]:  thematic.
[864.52s - 867.52s]:  Candidates, please, at this time, open all your envelopes.
[867.52s - 870.52s]:  Please, we open the envelopes.
[870.52s - 876.52s]:  And the candidates with colors that coincide interact with each other in the second interpellation.
[876.64s - 878.64s]:  We are going to show the colors.
[878.64s - 880.64s]:  We raise them a little bit.
[880.64s - 882.64s]:  Please, for the camera, candidate Cucalon, open your envelope.
[882.64s - 884.64s]:  Please, have them there for a moment.
[884.64s - 886.64s]:  Turn around, candidate Gerala.
[886.64s - 888.64s]:  Candidate Tabaki, please.
[888.64s - 892.64s]:  We raise the color so that you can observe it.
[892.64s - 894.64s]:  There they are.
[897.64s - 899.64s]:  We are seeing the colors of the candidates.
[899.64s - 901.64s]:  Let's start then.
[901.76s - 906.76s]:  Put them in the atrilles so that the color of the envelope is visible.
[908.76s - 915.76s]:  So, this is the second interpellation and the nature of the interpellation was the surprise.
[915.76s - 921.76s]:  The candidate Henry Cucalon, based on this draw, will be interpellated by the candidate Daniel Novoa.
[921.76s - 926.76s]:  Candidate Daniel Novoa has 15 seconds to interpellate candidate Cucalon from this moment.
[926.88s - 937.88s]:  Will he act in the same way that the government of the Aso acted regarding the prisons, the snide, and also the soft hand in drug trafficking?
[937.88s - 939.88s]:  Thank you candidate Novoa.
[939.88s - 942.88s]:  Candidate Cucalon has 30 seconds to respond now.
[942.88s - 944.88s]:  I am Henry Cucalon, candidate to president.
[944.88s - 946.88s]:  The candidate of creed is on the left.
[946.88s - 950.88s]:  I will have the capacity, the decision and the firmness to execute him.
[951.00s - 957.00s]:  I will fulfill my promise because I have not made a pact with the criminal groups or the mafia groups.
[957.00s - 965.00s]:  I do not lie for every tooth like other candidates who offered in the previous debate to make up to prisons with boats.
[965.00s - 967.00s]:  So, I will fulfill the promise of the people of Cotero.
[967.00s - 969.00s]:  I have the interest to do so.
[969.00s - 971.00s]:  Thank you candidate Henry Cucalon.
[971.00s - 977.00s]:  We are going to the candidate Jimmy Jairala who will respond the question in 90 seconds.
[977.00s - 979.00s]:  I will read it again.
[979.12s - 985.12s]:  The minors are now recruited by the organized crime for their illegal acts and businesses.
[985.12s - 991.12s]:  Do you agree candidate that minors be punished for serious crimes as adults?
[991.12s - 993.12s]:  You have 90 seconds from now.
[993.12s - 997.12s]:  I agree that minors be punished as adults.
[997.12s - 1005.12s]:  What I do not agree is that they keep prisoners in the same prisons that exist in the country.
[1005.24s - 1009.24s]:  They are authentic universities of crime.
[1009.24s - 1015.24s]:  When they are older, they have to keep prisoners there like any other citizen.
[1015.24s - 1021.24s]:  I also think that the state owes young people, is in debt with young people.
[1021.24s - 1027.24s]:  They have to work in prevention programs, football schools, music, art, etc.
[1027.36s - 1037.36s]:  So that young people from a very young age have another element to distract themselves and do not fall into the hands of drug traffickers or microtraffickers.
[1037.36s - 1045.36s]:  But we understand that the problem in the background is that we continue to see the passage of drugs through the northern border.
[1045.36s - 1047.36s]:  The northern border is almost neglected.
[1047.36s - 1053.36s]:  Tons of drugs are entered every day and what needs to be done is militarize the northern border.
[1053.48s - 1059.48s]:  We have to militarize the ports and defend the territorial sea and airspace with military.
[1059.48s - 1065.48s]:  As long as drugs are entered through the northern border, the dirty money will continue to corrupt society.
[1065.48s - 1073.48s]:  This dirty money has to be controlled by a powerful UAF, a more technical than political UAF.
[1073.48s - 1077.48s]:  I am prepared and I have the will to do so.
[1077.60s - 1083.60s]:  Thank you, candidate Jaira. According to the previous draw, the first interpellation to your answer will be done in 15 seconds.
[1083.60s - 1086.60s]:  Candidate Enrique Calon from now on.
[1086.60s - 1088.60s]:  Ecuador for the Ecuadorians.
[1088.60s - 1096.60s]:  Candidate, what is your opinion on the policies of the Universal Union, the constitution of Monte Cristo and on the decrees that the current governor has asked for on the issue of regularization of Venezuelans?
[1096.72s - 1100.72s]:  Candidate Jim Jaira, you have 30 seconds to answer the first interpellation.
[1100.72s - 1102.72s]:  Now.
[1102.72s - 1106.72s]:  I consider candidate that there are moments for the situations that you describe.
[1106.72s - 1109.72s]:  This is not the time to have open borders.
[1109.72s - 1115.72s]:  We have to ask all foreign citizens who want to enter the country to leave.
[1115.72s - 1117.72s]:  We have to ask them to leave.
[1117.72s - 1119.72s]:  We have to ask them to leave.
[1119.72s - 1121.72s]:  We have to ask them to leave.
[1121.84s - 1129.84s]:  We have to ask all foreign citizens who want to enter Ecuador to have their documents in order.
[1129.84s - 1136.84s]:  Because every foreigner who enters Ecuador is not only exploited in Ecuador, but also an Ecuadorian, no less, with work.
[1136.84s - 1140.84s]:  My obligation as president is to take care of the work of my compatriots.
[1140.84s - 1142.84s]:  Thank you candidate Jim Jaira.
[1142.84s - 1150.84s]:  And according to the color of the card that you have, which is white, candidate Tillería will now interpell in 15 seconds from now on.
[1151.84s - 1162.84s]:  During the previous government we realized that organized crime grew strongly.
[1162.84s - 1164.84s]:  What do you think will be different in your government?
[1164.84s - 1167.84s]:  Candidate Jaira will answer in 30 seconds.
[1167.84s - 1175.84s]:  With the militarization of the borders, of the ports, with the reinforcement of the national police,
[1175.84s - 1180.84s]:  we will be able to lower the levels of organized crime, of blood on the streets.
[1180.96s - 1188.96s]:  Because as long as the northern border is open, and the southern border is open, and the drug continues to enter, we will have the problem.
[1188.96s - 1192.96s]:  Because if the drug does not enter, the drug is not sold, and if it is not sold, it is not washed.
[1192.96s - 1194.96s]:  And if it is not washed, there are no illegal businesses.
[1196.96s - 1198.96s]:  Thank you candidate Jim Jaira.
[1198.96s - 1202.96s]:  It is now your turn to answer the same question to candidate Francesco Tabaki.
[1202.96s - 1204.96s]:  I recap the question candidate.
[1205.08s - 1211.08s]:  The minors of age are now recruited by organized crime for their illegal businesses.
[1211.08s - 1218.08s]:  Do you agree that minors for serious crimes are penalized as adults?
[1218.08s - 1222.08s]:  You have 90 seconds to answer. The time is running now.
[1222.08s - 1224.08s]:  The answer is yes.
[1224.08s - 1228.08s]:  And it's a shame that they already started fighting, the debate is not starting well.
[1228.20s - 1236.20s]:  We have to have a hard hand, and for that we are going to form the squadron of peace,
[1236.20s - 1241.20s]:  formed by the two thousand best elements of the national police and the armed forces,
[1241.20s - 1248.20s]:  trained by countries with whom we have cooperations like the United States, El Salvador, and the United Nations,
[1248.20s - 1253.20s]:  which will be in charge of selecting and selecting these two thousand men
[1253.32s - 1259.32s]:  so that the tragedy of the four children never happens again and that no innocent person leaves us.
[1259.32s - 1264.32s]:  National police and armed forces, I direct you to have the tranquility of my commitment
[1264.32s - 1270.32s]:  that you and your families will not lack your salary or your social security.
[1270.32s - 1276.32s]:  But from the first day that this selection begins, we will begin a state depuration
[1276.32s - 1280.32s]:  of all state entities, starting with those who take care of us.
[1280.44s - 1285.44s]:  When I was governor of Guayas, together with you, national police and armed forces,
[1285.44s - 1289.44s]:  we took to prison about 12,000 criminals,
[1289.44s - 1294.44s]:  who in less than a year were released by corrupt judges and prosecutors.
[1294.44s - 1299.44s]:  That is why I am going to ask for the perpetual chain for the murderers, rapists,
[1299.44s - 1304.44s]:  and vaccine-makers, for the terrorists, and for the corrupt judges and prosecutors.
[1304.44s - 1308.44s]:  For the corrupt judges and prosecutors who release them,
[1308.56s - 1312.56s]:  we will do it together, with a hard hand, a just hand, and a smart hand.
[1312.56s - 1315.56s]:  Thank you, candidate Tabaki. According to the previous draw,
[1315.56s - 1320.56s]:  the first interpellation to your answer will be made by candidate Luis Felipe Tillería in 15 seconds.
[1320.56s - 1322.56s]:  The time is running out.
[1322.56s - 1326.56s]:  Correismo made a deal with the drug dealers. The Phoenix plan does not end.
[1326.56s - 1331.56s]:  Would you agree to condemn with firmness, right now, in front of the Ecuadorians,
[1331.56s - 1336.56s]:  in this debate, the disastrous handling that Rafael Novoa has had in security?
[1338.56s - 1343.56s]:  Thank you, candidate Tillería. Candidate Francesco Tabaki, 30 seconds to answer now.
[1343.56s - 1346.56s]:  As I will have a hard hand, I will have a just hand.
[1346.56s - 1351.56s]:  And we are going to give the peace plan, weapons bids,
[1351.56s - 1355.56s]:  to those who give us their weapons, to the criminals who give us their weapons,
[1355.56s - 1360.56s]:  they are waiting for bids for their children, sports, art, culture, internet, and of course, education.
[1360.56s - 1365.56s]:  It is controversial, but no one is born with a criminal vocation.
[1365.68s - 1368.68s]:  If you want to do things in the country well, you will have the opportunities.
[1368.68s - 1370.68s]:  And we are going to break the circle.
[1370.68s - 1372.68s]:  We have to do it together, quickly and now.
[1372.68s - 1374.68s]:  Thank you, candidate Tabaki.
[1374.68s - 1379.68s]:  Candidate Juan Egan and Iván Cueva coincide with the color of candidate Francesco Tabaki.
[1379.68s - 1383.68s]:  Candidate Cueva has 15 seconds to question candidate Tabaki.
[1383.68s - 1385.68s]:  The time is running now.
[1385.68s - 1387.68s]:  Francesco, you have spoken of the peace plan.
[1387.68s - 1391.68s]:  How much and in what time will you execute that plan?
[1391.80s - 1395.80s]:  Thank you candidate Cueva, candidate Tabaki, 30 seconds to answer.
[1395.80s - 1400.80s]:  90 days, 2000 men, 200 million dollars.
[1400.80s - 1407.80s]:  Maybe it is a difficult measure, but I will tell you something Juan, candidate.
[1407.80s - 1414.80s]:  The last debate, a little over a year ago, was about the same issue, about security.
[1414.80s - 1416.80s]:  Right now we are talking about the same thing.
[1416.92s - 1423.92s]:  And if we do not do something totally different, the next debate in four years will continue to talk about the same thing.
[1423.92s - 1427.92s]:  So things have to be done quickly, together and well.
[1427.92s - 1428.92s]:  Thank you candidate Tabaki.
[1428.92s - 1430.92s]:  It is the turn of candidate Jorge Escala.
[1430.92s - 1433.92s]:  He will have 90 seconds to answer this question.
[1433.92s - 1437.92s]:  I am going to read it again because it is precisely within the rules of this debate.
[1437.92s - 1438.92s]:  And the question says,
[1438.92s - 1444.92s]:  The minors are today recruited by the organized crime for their illegal acts and businesses.
[1445.04s - 1452.04s]:  Do you agree candidate that minors be punished for serious crimes as adults?
[1452.04s - 1455.04s]:  You have 90 seconds from now.
[1455.04s - 1458.04s]:  Children are protected and educated.
[1458.04s - 1463.04s]:  In my government I will apply the school reinsertion plan.
[1463.04s - 1468.04s]:  There are 200,000 children who are outside the education system.
[1468.04s - 1472.04s]:  I will recover them from the claws of the criminal gangs.
[1472.16s - 1478.16s]:  It is so easy to talk about the hard hand when you live in Mocolí with bodyguards.
[1478.16s - 1484.16s]:  While the Ecuadorian families live every day with robberies and vaccines.
[1484.16s - 1486.16s]:  This must end now.
[1486.16s - 1489.16s]:  The first day I sit in Carondelet,
[1489.16s - 1496.16s]:  I will sign the decree to lower the narco generals of the armed forces
[1496.16s - 1501.16s]:  and the police that are committed to the big caps.
[1501.28s - 1506.28s]:  I will apply hard hand to restructure the intelligence service and the WAFE
[1506.28s - 1510.28s]:  so that the money laundering in the bank ends.
[1510.28s - 1514.28s]:  Hard hand to control the borders, ports, airports.
[1514.28s - 1523.28s]:  Hard hand to punish those who use banana to export drugs to Europe.
[1523.28s - 1526.28s]:  We will invest in education and work.
[1526.28s - 1529.28s]:  More work, more education.
[1529.40s - 1532.40s]:  It is the equation to reduce crime.
[1532.40s - 1536.40s]:  No more children or young people recruited by gangs.
[1536.40s - 1539.40s]:  It is the time of security.
[1539.40s - 1541.40s]:  It is the time of the people.
[1541.40s - 1544.40s]:  Candidate Escala according to the previous draw,
[1544.40s - 1547.40s]:  the first interpellation to your answer will be done in 15 seconds.
[1547.40s - 1550.40s]:  Candidate Jimmy Jairala from now on.
[1552.40s - 1554.40s]:  Candidate Escala,
[1554.52s - 1559.52s]:  where are you going to get the resources that will require the investment
[1559.52s - 1561.52s]:  that you have explained in your intervention?
[1561.52s - 1564.52s]:  Candidate Jorge Escala, when I tell you please,
[1564.52s - 1566.52s]:  you have 30 seconds from now.
[1566.52s - 1574.52s]:  Easy Jimmy, in my government we are going to recover the money from the SRI.
[1574.52s - 1579.52s]:  I will charge 11 billion dollars from the bank
[1579.52s - 1581.52s]:  and the big tax evasors.
[1581.64s - 1587.64s]:  Those resources will be used to guarantee security and life.
[1587.64s - 1591.64s]:  We are going to guarantee security and fight crime.
[1591.64s - 1593.64s]:  Who falls, falls.
[1593.64s - 1596.64s]:  Candidate Jorge Escala according to the color of your card,
[1596.64s - 1598.64s]:  which is blue,
[1598.64s - 1600.64s]:  will be interpelled in 15 seconds.
[1600.64s - 1603.64s]:  At this time, candidate Henry Kronfle from now on.
[1604.64s - 1608.64s]:  It is ridiculous that this government has not managed to control the prisons of the country.
[1608.76s - 1612.76s]:  Do you agree with me in blocking the communications of the prisons
[1612.76s - 1615.76s]:  and guaranteeing total control with the support of the police
[1615.76s - 1619.76s]:  and the forces to prevent them from being centers of crime?
[1619.76s - 1622.76s]:  Candidate Jorge Escala responds to the second interpellation.
[1622.76s - 1624.76s]:  You have 30 seconds now.
[1624.76s - 1628.76s]:  We are going to recover the control of the prisons in a true and efficient way.
[1628.76s - 1633.76s]:  We will apply a plan of integral rehabilitation.
[1633.76s - 1635.76s]:  We are going to overcome fear.
[1635.88s - 1639.88s]:  We are going to stop the car from money laundering in the private bank.
[1639.88s - 1645.88s]:  I will combat the corrupt structures of the state that you have directed.
[1645.88s - 1649.88s]:  I will build a safe country in which we defeat fear
[1649.88s - 1653.88s]:  and generate 500,000 jobs for our young people.
[1653.88s - 1655.88s]:  Thank you candidate Jorge Escala.
[1655.88s - 1657.88s]:  Candidates, a reminder.
[1657.88s - 1660.88s]:  It is important that you are attentive at the moment
[1660.88s - 1663.88s]:  that we as moderators give you the step
[1664.00s - 1666.00s]:  to respond or to interrupt,
[1666.00s - 1668.00s]:  so that you can run the time
[1668.00s - 1672.00s]:  because you have a limited time to interrupt or respond.
[1672.00s - 1676.00s]:  We are now going to the candidate Henry Cronfleck Osaya.
[1676.00s - 1679.00s]:  You have 90 seconds to answer the question.
[1679.00s - 1683.00s]:  The minors today are recruited by the criminal organization
[1683.00s - 1685.00s]:  for their illegal acts.
[1685.00s - 1688.00s]:  Do you agree candidate that the minors
[1688.00s - 1692.00s]:  for serious crimes are penalized as adults?
[1692.12s - 1694.12s]:  Run the time now. 90 seconds.
[1694.12s - 1699.12s]:  Six out of ten members of the GDO are minors of 19 years.
[1699.12s - 1703.12s]:  4.3 million children and girls have been deprived
[1703.12s - 1706.12s]:  of educational services due to the closure of schools
[1706.12s - 1707.12s]:  in conflict zones.
[1707.12s - 1708.12s]:  A tragedy is happening.
[1708.12s - 1712.12s]:  I agree that they are played when they commit atrocious crimes.
[1712.12s - 1716.12s]:  But I also agree that there are extracurricular activities
[1716.12s - 1718.12s]:  of culture, art and sport
[1718.12s - 1720.12s]:  and that there is a police guard in schools.
[1720.24s - 1722.24s]:  The crime does not stop in Ecuador.
[1722.24s - 1725.24s]:  This is the result of corruption,
[1725.24s - 1728.44s]:  complicity and impunity of the corrupt
[1728.44s - 1731.44s]:  and the improvisation and incapacity of this government.
[1731.44s - 1735.44s]:  The murder, the robbery, the rape, the kidnapping
[1735.44s - 1737.44s]:  and the vaccine do not stop.
[1737.44s - 1741.44s]:  Transnational crimes and drug trafficking do not stop.
[1741.44s - 1744.44s]:  They have also assaulted me with a gun in my head.
[1744.44s - 1747.44s]:  I know what parents feel when they go out
[1747.44s - 1749.44s]:  and their children do not return.
[1749.76s - 1750.76s]:  We all live in fear.
[1750.76s - 1753.76s]:  That is why we are going to apply hard hands against crime.
[1753.76s - 1757.76s]:  Four axes. Preventive, reactive, international crime
[1757.76s - 1758.76s]:  and zero corruption.
[1758.76s - 1761.76s]:  Police on the streets 24-7 on patrol.
[1761.76s - 1764.76s]:  Complete funding for the national police.
[1764.76s - 1766.76s]:  Prison control with inhibitors.

[1768.76s - 1771.76s]:  International cooperation and integration of databases.
[1771.76s - 1773.76s]:  But zero corruption.
[1773.76s - 1776.76s]:  We will put the corrupt judges and prosecutors in jail
[1776.76s - 1778.76s]:  with the same criminal penalties.
[1779.08s - 1781.08s]:  And there is no excuse. Listen to me well.
[1781.08s - 1783.08s]:  We are going to extradite Rafael Correa Delgado.
[1783.08s - 1785.08s]:  It is justice.
[1785.08s - 1787.08s]:  Thank you candidate Cronfle.
[1787.08s - 1789.08s]:  According to the previous raffle,
[1789.08s - 1791.08s]:  I mean the raffle carried out in advance
[1791.08s - 1793.08s]:  by the National Electoral Council,
[1793.08s - 1795.08s]:  the first intervention to your answer
[1795.08s - 1797.08s]:  will be carried out in 15 seconds.
[1797.08s - 1799.08s]:  Candidate Escala has 15 seconds.
[1799.08s - 1801.08s]:  Your time runs now.
[1804.08s - 1807.08s]:  Henry, you speak of security and hard hands.
[1807.08s - 1809.08s]:  But you have been part of the previous governments.
[1809.08s - 1811.08s]:  Will you support the policy of our government
[1811.08s - 1814.08s]:  to depute the narcos of the armed forces?
[1816.08s - 1818.08s]:  Candidate Henry Cronfle, from this moment on,
[1818.08s - 1820.08s]:  you have 30 seconds to answer.
[1820.08s - 1822.08s]:  Please run the time.
[1822.08s - 1828.08s]:  Hard hands means that the entire population is safe.
[1828.08s - 1831.08s]:  It doesn't matter who the criminal is.
[1831.08s - 1833.08s]:  If the criminal is from the street,
[1833.08s - 1835.08s]:  the criminal is from Cuello Blanco,
[1835.08s - 1839.08s]:  the criminal is from an international criminal gang,
[1839.08s - 1842.08s]:  or if the criminal is a member of the armed forces.
[1842.08s - 1845.08s]:  We are going to safeguard the people,
[1845.08s - 1847.08s]:  and that is hard hands.
[1847.08s - 1849.08s]:  Do everything you have to do
[1849.08s - 1851.08s]:  so that the people are safe and secure.
[1851.08s - 1853.08s]:  Thank you candidate Cronfle.
[1853.08s - 1855.08s]:  I made the clarification earlier about the raffle
[1855.08s - 1858.08s]:  because in the colors that were also given by raffle,
[1858.08s - 1860.08s]:  this has been validated by a notary,
[1860.08s - 1862.08s]:  the colors of the two candidates coincide.
[1862.08s - 1864.08s]:  Again, Jorge Escala
[1864.08s - 1866.08s]:  will have the opportunity to interrupt Henry Cronfle.
[1866.08s - 1868.08s]:  Candidate Escala has 15 seconds.
[1868.08s - 1870.08s]:  Your time starts now.
[1870.08s - 1873.08s]:  The Christian socialists and the Rally supported
[1873.08s - 1876.08s]:  Daniel's militarization policy.
[1876.08s - 1879.08s]:  How are you going to support our government
[1879.08s - 1882.08s]:  to guarantee justice for the families
[1882.08s - 1885.08s]:  of the four children of the Malvinas?
[1885.08s - 1886.08s]:  Thank you candidate Escala.
[1886.08s - 1889.08s]:  Candidate Henry Cronfle has 30 seconds.
[1889.08s - 1891.08s]:  Your time starts now.
[1891.08s - 1896.08s]:  We support public policies that are positive for the people.
[1896.08s - 1898.08s]:  They come from wherever they come from.
[1898.08s - 1900.08s]:  Political ideology doesn't matter.
[1900.08s - 1902.08s]:  If it's positive, we're going to support it.
[1902.08s - 1905.08s]:  So we will do everything in our power
[1905.08s - 1907.08s]:  to safeguard society.
[1907.08s - 1910.08s]:  And we will support any public policy
[1910.08s - 1913.08s]:  that reinforces the military and the national police
[1913.08s - 1916.08s]:  to fight crime in the streets and organized crime.
[1916.08s - 1918.08s]:  That is hard hands, I repeat.
[1918.08s - 1920.08s]:  That is hard hands.
[1920.08s - 1922.08s]:  Thank you candidate Henry Cronfle.
[1922.08s - 1924.08s]:  Now it's the turn of candidate Luis Felipe Tilleria.
[1924.08s - 1927.08s]:  It's time for your intervention in 90 seconds
[1927.08s - 1929.08s]:  after I read the question.
[1929.08s - 1931.08s]:  Children of age are today recruited by the crime
[1931.08s - 1933.08s]:  organized for their illegal acts and businesses.
[1933.08s - 1935.08s]:  Do you agree that children of age
[1935.08s - 1939.08s]:  for serious crimes are penalized as adults?
[1939.08s - 1942.08s]:  You have 90 seconds from now.
[1942.08s - 1945.08s]:  For the leaders, our plan is to search for them
[1945.08s - 1949.08s]:  dead or alive.
[1949.08s - 1952.08s]:  Our plan, artillery against crime,
[1952.08s - 1955.08s]:  will make this war win.
[1955.08s - 1958.08s]:  Prisoners will work as Chinese.
[1958.08s - 1960.08s]:  In our Chinese plan, yes.
[1960.08s - 1963.08s]:  Humanitarian center of inclusion and new opportunities.
[1963.08s - 1968.08s]:  Also, for children, we will have the family plan,
[1968.08s - 1970.08s]:  the Cuna de Valores.
[1970.08s - 1972.08s]:  All this, friends, we will do it with the help of God,
[1972.08s - 1974.08s]:  like David versus Goliath.
[1974.08s - 1977.08s]:  We will have the military service for young people,
[1977.08s - 1980.08s]:  and we will change the function of the armed forces
[1980.08s - 1982.08s]:  to be a dual function.
[1982.08s - 1984.08s]:  Like the Carabinieri of Italy,
[1984.08s - 1986.08s]:  who are ready to be military in times of war,
[1986.08s - 1989.08s]:  but in times of peace, like in the last 31 years.
[1989.08s - 1991.08s]:  At the same time, with the national police,
[1991.08s - 1993.08s]:  they will patrol the streets and neighborhoods
[1993.08s - 1995.08s]:  to eliminate the vaccines.
[1995.08s - 1999.08s]:  But we will also have the diplomacy of intelligence
[1999.08s - 2001.08s]:  against organized crime.
[2001.08s - 2004.08s]:  Did you know that 60% of the drugs in this country
[2004.08s - 2008.08s]:  are used in banana containers?
[2008.08s - 2010.08s]:  And do you know where it goes?
[2010.08s - 2012.08s]:  To Belgium.
[2012.08s - 2014.08s]:  Why?
[2014.08s - 2016.08s]:  Only international intelligence
[2016.08s - 2020.08s]:  will help us eliminate narcopolitics.
[2020.08s - 2022.08s]:  I come to reset the system,
[2022.08s - 2026.08s]:  because without a transparent,
[2026.08s - 2028.08s]:  not threatened and fair justice,
[2028.08s - 2031.08s]:  we will not be able to eliminate organized crime.
[2031.08s - 2033.08s]:  Candidate of Tillería, and according to the previous draw,
[2033.08s - 2035.08s]:  the first question to answer
[2035.08s - 2037.08s]:  will be done in 15 seconds.
[2037.08s - 2040.08s]:  Candidate Daniel Novo Bacín, from now on.
[2041.08s - 2045.08s]:  Candidate of Tillería, you mentioned security.
[2045.08s - 2047.08s]:  You said that in security you have to change the role of the armed forces.
[2047.08s - 2049.08s]:  Are you going to go against the popular mandate?
[2049.08s - 2052.08s]:  Are you going to go against the popular consultation?
[2053.08s - 2056.08s]:  Candidate Luis Felipe Tillería has 30 seconds to answer.
[2056.08s - 2058.08s]:  The first question, now.
[2058.08s - 2061.08s]:  On the contrary, what we are going to do is strengthen
[2061.08s - 2063.08s]:  the armed forces,
[2063.08s - 2065.08s]:  so that it is not something exceptional,
[2065.08s - 2067.08s]:  like an exceptional state of exception.
[2067.08s - 2070.08s]:  What we need is to optimize our resources.
[2070.08s - 2073.08s]:  As Italy did when it was poorer than Ecuador.
[2073.08s - 2076.08s]:  There has been no mafia, more mafia than the Italian mafia.
[2076.08s - 2079.08s]:  With which we have to optimize our resources
[2079.08s - 2081.08s]:  in this dual force.
[2081.08s - 2084.08s]:  That the military can be military in times of war,
[2084.08s - 2086.08s]:  but in times of peace,
[2086.08s - 2089.08s]:  control the neighborhoods together with our police.
[2089.08s - 2091.08s]:  Candidate Luis Felipe Tillería,
[2091.08s - 2093.08s]:  according to the color of the card you have,
[2093.08s - 2095.08s]:  which is white,
[2095.08s - 2098.08s]:  the one who has 15 seconds of interpellation
[2098.08s - 2100.08s]:  is candidate Jimmy Jirala.
[2100.08s - 2101.08s]:  Now, please.
[2101.08s - 2105.08s]:  Candidate Tillería, as I propose to militarize the border
[2105.08s - 2108.08s]:  to avoid the indiscriminate passage of drugs,
[2108.08s - 2111.08s]:  what do you propose to control that transit
[2111.08s - 2114.08s]:  that has turned us into an international shame?
[2114.08s - 2118.08s]:  Candidate Tillería, answer in 30 seconds, now.
[2118.08s - 2122.08s]:  In addition to using our more than 100,000 reservists
[2122.08s - 2124.08s]:  for the control of the borders,
[2124.08s - 2126.08s]:  we also have to control the prisons,
[2126.08s - 2129.08s]:  because they are the centers of command of organized crime.
[2129.08s - 2132.08s]:  With us, the SNAI will go to their house.
[2132.08s - 2135.08s]:  The prisons will be passed on to the reservists
[2135.08s - 2136.08s]:  of the armed forces,
[2136.08s - 2138.08s]:  so that they can be broken every three weeks
[2138.08s - 2140.08s]:  to avoid contamination.
[2140.08s - 2142.08s]:  We have more than 100,000 of them.
[2142.08s - 2145.08s]:  But in addition, the prisoners will work like Chinese
[2145.08s - 2149.08s]:  so that we can sell that labor force abroad.
[2149.08s - 2151.08s]:  Thank you, candidate Tillería.
[2151.08s - 2153.08s]:  We are now going to talk to candidate Juan Iván Cueva.
[2153.08s - 2156.08s]:  You have 90 seconds to answer the question
[2156.08s - 2159.08s]:  made by the National Debate Committee.
[2159.08s - 2163.08s]:  Young people today are recruited by organized crime
[2163.08s - 2166.08s]:  for their illegal acts and businesses.
[2166.08s - 2169.08s]:  Do you agree that young people
[2169.08s - 2173.08s]:  for serious crimes are penalized as adults?
[2173.08s - 2175.08s]:  The time of 90 seconds is now.
[2175.08s - 2176.08s]:  Thank you, Fabricio.
[2176.08s - 2179.08s]:  Many of the answers we have heard from the candidates
[2179.08s - 2181.08s]:  I would support them.
[2181.08s - 2184.08s]:  However, I am going to defend Ecuador.
[2184.08s - 2186.08s]:  Do you know how many people die
[2186.08s - 2189.08s]:  for the theft of a cell phone every year?
[2189.08s - 2192.08s]:  In my government, no one else will die
[2192.08s - 2195.08s]:  for the theft of a cell phone.
[2195.08s - 2197.08s]:  Cell phone plan for life.
[2197.08s - 2199.08s]:  I will force operators
[2199.08s - 2201.08s]:  in the renegotiation of their frequencies
[2201.08s - 2205.08s]:  to offer you a security of anti-theft
[2205.08s - 2209.08s]:  so that you can get your cell phone back.
[2209.08s - 2211.08s]:  We need firmness against crime.
[2211.08s - 2214.08s]:  That is why we are going to invest $660 million
[2214.08s - 2217.08s]:  in the zero-dealing plan.
[2217.08s - 2220.08s]:  With artificial intelligence, facial recognition,
[2220.08s - 2222.08s]:  reading of plates, prediction of behavior,
[2222.08s - 2225.08s]:  so the criminals will not be able to hide
[2225.08s - 2228.08s]:  under the stones.
[2228.08s - 2230.08s]:  The public and the army will have
[2230.08s - 2233.08s]:  all the attention of the state.
[2233.08s - 2236.08s]:  I do think about their families.
[2236.08s - 2238.08s]:  Bacchus for their children,
[2238.08s - 2240.08s]:  health insurance and life insurance.
[2240.08s - 2243.08s]:  The good elements, all the attention
[2243.08s - 2245.08s]:  of the national government.
[2245.08s - 2247.08s]:  The bad ones will go to jail.
[2247.08s - 2249.08s]:  I will run tests of confidence,
[2249.08s - 2251.08s]:  financial analysis and a polygraph.
[2251.08s - 2253.08s]:  I am going for the more than 1,500
[2253.08s - 2255.08s]:  that are corrupt and rotten.
[2255.08s - 2257.08s]:  But not only with lead,
[2257.08s - 2259.08s]:  security is solved.
[2259.08s - 2261.08s]:  That is why we have the Minyan plan,
[2261.08s - 2263.08s]:  where we will create community and cultural centers,
[2263.08s - 2265.08s]:  classrooms, libraries,
[2265.08s - 2267.08s]:  cants...
[2267.08s - 2269.08s]:  Your time is up, candidate Juan Iván Cueva.
[2269.08s - 2271.08s]:  In the previous draw,
[2271.08s - 2273.08s]:  the first question to answer
[2273.08s - 2275.08s]:  will be answered in 15 seconds by
[2275.08s - 2277.08s]:  candidate Henry Cronfleck-Ozaya.
[2277.08s - 2279.08s]:  Your time, candidate Cronfleck,
[2279.08s - 2281.08s]:  is now 15 seconds.
[2281.08s - 2283.08s]:  Do you agree
[2283.08s - 2285.08s]:  that the corrupt judges
[2285.08s - 2287.08s]:  have to go to jail
[2287.08s - 2289.08s]:  with the same sentences
[2289.08s - 2291.08s]:  and at the same time
[2291.08s - 2293.08s]:  with the criminals they released?
[2293.08s - 2295.08s]:  Thank you, candidate Cronfleck.
[2295.08s - 2297.08s]:  Candidate Cueva has 30 seconds
[2297.08s - 2299.08s]:  to answer from this moment.
[2299.08s - 2301.08s]:  Of course, Henry.
[2301.08s - 2303.08s]:  Who would not agree
[2303.08s - 2305.08s]:  in this type of measure,
[2305.08s - 2307.08s]:  which is beneficial for security
[2307.08s - 2309.08s]:  and for the country?
[2309.08s - 2311.08s]:  We have to rebuild
[2311.08s - 2313.08s]:  the social fabric.
[2313.08s - 2315.08s]:  The insecurity problem
[2315.08s - 2317.08s]:  is due to the lack of opportunities,
[2317.08s - 2319.08s]:  work and prosperity that families
[2319.08s - 2321.08s]:  do not have at the moment.
[2321.08s - 2323.08s]:  Because many young people
[2323.08s - 2325.08s]:  or many heads of families
[2325.08s - 2327.08s]:  in their desperation to bring bread
[2327.08s - 2329.08s]:  to their homes make decisions that are not suitable
[2329.08s - 2331.08s]:  and are taken by the criminal groups.
[2331.08s - 2333.08s]:  Thank you, candidate Cueva.
[2333.08s - 2335.08s]:  According to the coincidence of the colors,
[2335.08s - 2337.08s]:  this second question
[2337.08s - 2339.08s]:  is for candidate Cueva
[2339.08s - 2341.08s]:  by candidate Francesco Tabaki.
[2341.08s - 2343.08s]:  Candidate Tabaki has 15 seconds
[2343.08s - 2345.08s]:  to formulate the question to candidate Cueva.
[2345.08s - 2347.08s]:  The time starts now.
[2347.08s - 2349.08s]:  Candidate, what is your proposal
[2349.08s - 2351.08s]:  to fight against violence against women?
[2351.08s - 2353.08s]:  6 out of 10 women are raped
[2353.08s - 2355.08s]:  in Ecuador. I make a call to the CNE.
[2355.08s - 2357.08s]:  The subject of women does not appear
[2357.08s - 2359.08s]:  in any of the axes.
[2359.08s - 2361.08s]:  Thank you, candidate Tabaki.
[2361.08s - 2363.08s]:  30 seconds to answer
[2363.08s - 2365.08s]:  candidate Cueva. Please, the time starts now.
[2365.08s - 2367.08s]:  Excellent question, Francesco.
[2367.08s - 2369.08s]:  That is why we must start
[2369.08s - 2371.08s]:  with the example of education
[2371.08s - 2373.08s]:  in our young people. In my government,
[2373.08s - 2375.08s]:  that is why Cristina Reyes is with me
[2375.08s - 2377.08s]:  who will make important decisions
[2377.08s - 2379.08s]:  in the power.
[2379.08s - 2381.08s]:  This, the government of Juan Iván Cueva,
[2381.08s - 2383.08s]:  the government of the citizens,
[2383.08s - 2385.08s]:  will be the government of women.
[2385.08s - 2387.08s]:  We will save that historical finger
[2387.08s - 2389.08s]:  that the national government has had
[2389.08s - 2391.08s]:  with women. We are going for the education
[2391.08s - 2393.08s]:  of children, of young people
[2393.08s - 2395.08s]:  and we will save that.
[2395.08s - 2397.08s]:  Thank you, candidate Cueva.
[2397.08s - 2399.08s]:  Now, candidate Daniel Novoacin
[2399.08s - 2401.08s]:  answers in 90 seconds.
[2401.08s - 2403.08s]:  The question, we remind you that we are
[2403.08s - 2405.08s]:  in the axis of security and crime prevention.
[2405.08s - 2407.08s]:  Young people today are recruited
[2407.08s - 2409.08s]:  by the organized crime for their illegal
[2409.08s - 2411.08s]:  acts and businesses.
[2411.08s - 2413.08s]:  Do you agree that young people
[2413.08s - 2415.08s]:  for serious crimes are penalized
[2415.08s - 2417.08s]:  as adults? 90 seconds
[2417.08s - 2419.08s]:  from now on, candidate.
[2419.08s - 2421.08s]:  I agree since I was 15 years old.
[2421.08s - 2423.08s]:  But we have to work as a state,
[2423.08s - 2425.08s]:  as we are doing now. First,
[2425.08s - 2427.08s]:  we must also highlight
[2427.08s - 2429.08s]:  the numbers. We have reduced
[2429.08s - 2431.08s]:  violence deaths by more than 15 percent,
[2431.08s - 2433.08s]:  we have reduced femicides by 25 percent
[2433.08s - 2435.08s]:  and everything in one year.
[2435.08s - 2437.08s]:  The Phoenix Plan is working,
[2437.08s - 2439.08s]:  but nothing is resolved
[2439.08s - 2441.08s]:  in one year.
[2441.08s - 2443.08s]:  We must also have
[2443.08s - 2445.08s]:  integrated security with technology.
[2445.08s - 2447.08s]:  The protection of the border is what they say,
[2447.08s - 2449.08s]:  to block the borders for foreigners
[2449.08s - 2451.08s]:  asking for judicial pass.
[2451.08s - 2453.08s]:  We are doing that right now.
[2453.08s - 2455.08s]:  We are giving security to the
[2455.08s - 2457.08s]:  ports right now. We have been awarded
[2457.08s - 2459.08s]:  by the European Union and the United States
[2459.08s - 2461.08s]:  for what we are doing in the ports.
[2461.08s - 2463.08s]:  At the same time, we have given respect
[2463.08s - 2465.08s]:  to the armed forces and the police
[2465.08s - 2467.08s]:  that are needed instead of just attacking
[2467.08s - 2469.08s]:  as a large part of this panel has done.
[2469.08s - 2471.08s]:  We must also understand
[2471.08s - 2473.08s]:  that the families of the military and the police
[2473.08s - 2475.08s]:  are important.
[2475.08s - 2477.08s]:  And about women, we are the most feminine
[2477.08s - 2479.08s]:  and the most equal in the history of Ecuador.
[2479.08s - 2481.08s]:  You can see that in numbers,
[2481.08s - 2483.08s]:  you can see it in the pages I mentioned
[2483.08s - 2485.08s]:  at the beginning. And that is
[2485.08s - 2487.08s]:  we must understand that corruption
[2487.08s - 2489.08s]:  must be cut,
[2489.08s - 2491.08s]:  whether male or female.
[2491.08s - 2493.08s]:  That will make us change
[2493.08s - 2495.08s]:  as a country.
[2497.08s - 2499.08s]:  Can I use your remaining seconds,
[2499.08s - 2501.08s]:  candidate?
[2501.08s - 2503.08s]:  You have seven seconds, right? Thank you, candidate.
[2503.08s - 2505.08s]:  In the previous draw,
[2505.08s - 2507.08s]:  the first question to answer
[2507.08s - 2509.08s]:  will be done in 15 seconds.
[2509.08s - 2511.08s]:  Candidate Francesco Tabaki, now.
[2511.08s - 2513.08s]:  Candidate Novoa,
[2513.08s - 2515.08s]:  the tragedy of the four children
[2515.08s - 2517.08s]:  broke us all. Many of us have been silent,
[2517.08s - 2519.08s]:  but the president of the republic
[2519.08s - 2521.08s]:  cannot be silent. Tell us
[2521.08s - 2523.08s]:  the names of the four children
[2523.08s - 2525.08s]:  and decide if you ask the country
[2525.08s - 2527.08s]:  to forgive you, which will do us good.
[2527.08s - 2529.08s]:  Candidate Daniel Novoa,
[2529.08s - 2531.08s]:  you have 30 seconds to answer
[2531.08s - 2533.08s]:  the first question. Now.
[2533.08s - 2535.08s]:  There was no question there.
[2535.08s - 2537.08s]:  There was no question there,
[2537.08s - 2539.08s]:  but we are going to talk about numbers.
[2539.08s - 2541.08s]:  When Mr. Tabaki was governor of Guayas,
[2541.08s - 2543.08s]:  it was the most violent time
[2543.08s - 2545.08s]:  in the history of the province.
[2545.08s - 2547.08s]:  We have improved it by 22%.
[2547.08s - 2549.08s]:  And all the people involved
[2549.08s - 2551.08s]:  in the case of the Malvinas
[2551.08s - 2553.08s]:  will account for justice.
[2553.08s - 2555.08s]:  We do not overlap with anyone,
[2555.08s - 2557.08s]:  nor do we overlap with anyone
[2557.08s - 2559.08s]:  like Case Encounter,
[2559.08s - 2561.08s]:  which led us to an energy crisis

[3001.82s - 3003.34s]:  maestros son
[3003.34s - 3009.74s]:  Médicos son policías son elementos de las fuerzas armadas de modo que lo que hay que hacer es un estado eficiente
[3010.26s - 3018.42s]:  Porque ha fracasado el estado en materia energética porque ha querido hacerlo todo porque ha querido acapararlo todo por eso no tenemos inversión
[3018.50s - 3020.66s]:  internacional yo propongo la
[3021.38s - 3027.42s]:  concesión de determinados de determinadas áreas de generación de energía como por ejemplo las hidroeléctricas
[3027.66s - 3033.50s]:  Hay un proyecto que se llama cartenillo santiago que vale seis mil millones de dólares que si lo concesionamos utilizando el sistema
[3034.34s - 3039.94s]:  Construye opera y devuelve concesión generaría seis mil millones de dólares al estado ecuatoriano

[3197.50s - 3213.50s]:  Sí y el eje sobre los servicios que da el estado merece que se hable de todo un poco así que voy a empezar por la salud por el IES y por el MSP ministerio de salud pública lo que le estamos ofreciendo a nuestra gente no está nada bien
[3213.50s - 3236.50s]:  Que debemos hacer debemos de inmediatamente copiar el modelo exitoso de solca y de la junta de beneficencia ellos han utilizado me han utilizado herramientas tecnológicas administrativas las cuales les permite no solo medir la el gasto sino también medir la calidad y lo que la gente está pagando lo que la gente está sufriendo
[3236.50s - 3252.50s]:  Luego viene la educación tenemos una educación a donde no tenemos suficientes carreras para nuestros alumnos los cupos están limitados tenemos que ampliar los cupos en las 31 universidades públicas así como dar un nivel o educación a la distancia especialmente en la ruralidad
[3252.50s - 3277.50s]:  Y finalmente en el eje de la energía tenemos que tener claro que hemos fracasado que si tenemos energía es porque ha llovido San Pedro nos ha ayudado y si a mí me preguntan yo estoy aquí para decir la verdad no vamos a tener energía sino importamos la energía o si no llueve por eso es importantísimo copiar los modelos de Perú y de Colombia abrirle las puertas a la inversión extranjera y a la empresa privada y tenemos que hacerlo rápido y con una visión de seguridad y de seguridad

[3365.50s - 3367.50s]:  Candidato Tabaki 30 segundos corre tiempo
[3367.50s - 3381.50s]:  Se lo contesté anteriormente hay que tomar en cuenta los modelos exitosos los modelos que han dado resultados como el de Solca como el de la junta de beneficencia de Guayaquil ellos tienen herramientas tecnológicas
[3381.50s - 3399.50s]:  Herramientas que miden la satisfacción del cliente no solo el gasto hay que tener claro que el modelo caduco de la junta de el IES y de el MSP es tan caduco que es el que tenemos desde el inicio hay que cambiarlo y nuevamente hay que hacerlo juntos rápido
[3400.50s - 3409.50s]:  Gracias candidato Tabaki ahora vamos con el candidato Jorge Escala 90 segundos para responder interrogante de este segundo eje que tiene que ver con eficiencia del estado y servicios públicos
[3409.50s - 3418.50s]:  Es responsabilidad del estado prestar servicios públicos de calidad pero en 2024 sufrimos apagones de hasta 14 horas diarias

[3544.50s - 3549.50s]:  Gracias candidato Novoa, los 30 segundos para responder el candidato Escala corren ahora
[3550.50s - 3557.50s]:  Una muletilla que usted no ha podido demostrarla y hasta ahora no ha podido combatirla, es parte de la corrupción de su gobierno
[3557.50s - 3570.50s]:  Daniel, ha fracasado en seguridad, recortaste 2 mil millones de dólares de educación y salud, tus apagones le costaron el empleo a más de 240 mil personas
[3571.50s - 3579.50s]:  Mientras tú defiendes privilegio, nosotros defendemos derechos, nosotros invertiremos en seguridad, trabajo, vivienda
[3580.50s - 3588.50s]:  Gracias candidato Escala, y ahora las tarjetas coinciden en los colores y se repite la interpelación con los mismos candidatos

[3594.50s - 3600.50s]:  Fracaso es llevar 25 años con un mismo mensaje que todavía nadie lo apoye, usted planea eliminar el subsidio eléctrico a las mineras y grandes empresas
[3601.50s - 3604.50s]:  Quería preguntarle si está al tanto el decreto 367, donde ya hicimos lo que plantea
[3605.50s - 3608.50s]:  Candidato Jorge Escala tiene 30 segundos para responder, su tiempo corre ahora
[3609.50s - 3618.50s]:  Claro, todos tus decretos son atentatoria a los intereses de la nación y de la patria, en mi gobierno lo vamos a derogar
[3619.50s - 3629.50s]:  con el propósito de defender el patrimonio estatal que tú estás rifando, estás vendiendo la patria, en mi gobierno defenderemos a la patria y nuestros recursos
[3629.50s - 3636.50s]:  Gracias candidato Escala, candidato Enricrón Flecosalla, es su turno, va a responder la pregunta en 90 segundos, que se la voy a leer nuevamente y dice
[3637.50s - 3644.50s]:  Es responsabilidad del Estado prestar servicios públicos de calidad, pero en el 2024 sufrimos apagones de hasta 14 horas diarias
[3645.50s - 3655.50s]:  En su gobierno, revisará los tarifarios para garantizar la provisión de servicios públicos como la energía eléctrica, telefonía o conectividad, entre otros, tiene 90 segundos, corre tiempo
[3656.50s - 3664.50s]:  Lo revisaré a la baja, porque eso genera competitividad abriendo para que el sector privado también pueda licitar en estos aspectos
[3665.50s - 3672.50s]:  El Estado es un lagarto que traga y no vomita, traga impuestos y no da servicios hoy en día
[3673.50s - 3678.50s]:  El correísmo lo convirtió en una máquina corrupta para servir a su círculo cercano
[3678.50s - 3684.50s]:  Hasta hoy este gobierno no ha sido capaz de cambiarlo, al contrario, lo sigue alimentando
[3685.50s - 3696.50s]:  Mi propuesta es clara en cinco ejes, reducción, modernización y eficacia del Estado, salud, educación, obras y servicios públicos y energía, petróleo y minería
[3697.50s - 3702.50s]:  Modernicemos, gobierno en tu celular, trámites de tu teléfono inmediatos con control posterior
[3703.50s - 3707.50s]:  Escúchame, jóvenes, Universidad Central gratuita en línea
[3708.50s - 3717.50s]:  Tres, retomaremos las escuelas comunitarias, el sector rural sabe a qué me refiero y la educación será obligatoria en el Ecuador
[3718.50s - 3722.50s]:  Cuatro, plan de vivienda de 500.000 casas para parejas jóvenes y para los más pobres
[3723.50s - 3729.50s]:  Atención inmediata en salud a través de clínicas privadas con medicina de forma gratuita
[3729.50s - 3735.50s]:  El Estado pagará la factura, Elías pasará a manos de los afiliados y no permitiremos que se le siga metiendo la mano
[3736.50s - 3741.50s]:  Vamos a diversificar la matriz energética y generaremos a través del sector privado sin límites
[3742.50s - 3745.50s]:  Y vamos a liquidar a Petro Ecuador sacándole las mafias y licitándola
[3746.50s - 3750.50s]:  Gracias, candidato Cronfley, la primera interpelación a su respuesta la va a realizar en 15 segundos
[3751.50s - 3752.50s]:  El candidato Francesco Tabaki, adelante
[3753.50s - 3757.50s]:  Candidato, usted habla de dejarle cinco puntos al IVA, full demagógico
[3758.50s - 3765.50s]:  Eso hay que tener claro que le va a costar al Estado 2.800 millones de dólares y van a ser afectados los servicios públicos
[3766.50s - 3767.50s]:  ¿De dónde los piensa recuperar?
[3768.50s - 3772.50s]:  Candidato, Henry Cronfley, tiene 30 segundos para responder esta primera interpelación, ahora
[3773.50s - 3781.50s]:  Tienes un error conceptual, Francesco, bajar el IVA no quiere decir reducir la tributación, reducir la recolección del dinero
[3782.50s - 3786.50s]:  Al contrario, es expandir la economía para que el Estado recaude más
[3787.50s - 3792.50s]:  Segundo, las empresas públicas van a estar en manos de los colegios profesionales para que puedan darle dinero al Estado
[3793.50s - 3796.50s]:  Tercero, la modernización del gobierno va a ahorrar bastantes costos
[3797.50s - 3801.50s]:  Cuatro, combatimos la corrupción y de ahí vamos a sacar el dinero
[3802.50s - 3806.50s]:  Candidato, Luis Felipe Tillería, usted va a realizar la segunda interpelación al candidato Henry Cronfley-Cosalla
[3807.50s - 3812.50s]:  Porque coinciden los colores de las tarjetas, tienen plomo los dos, tiene 15 segundos a partir de ahora
[3813.50s - 3815.50s]:  Ecuador actualmente produce esto de energía
[3816.50s - 3823.50s]:  Podemos y tenemos la capacidad de generar todo esto incluyendo energía nuclear porque tenemos en la cordillera del cóndor uranio
[3824.50s - 3827.50s]:  ¿Piensa usted romper el secuestro estatal de los sectores estratégicos?
[3827.50s - 3832.50s]:  Candidato, Henry Cronfley-Cosalla, responde a la segunda interpelación, 30 segundos, corre tiempo
[3833.50s - 3842.50s]:  Vamos a permitir que cualquier privado produzca energía a cualquier monto y le pague el peaje por distribución y transmisión al gobierno
[3843.50s - 3846.50s]:  No va a necesitar que el gobierno le pague al privado, eso como primer punto
[3847.50s - 3850.50s]:  Segundo punto, la diversificación energética es crucial en el Ecuador
[3850.50s - 3857.50s]:  Energía eólita y fotovoltaica en el día, hidroeléctrica en la noche y termoeléctrica cuando fallen uno de los dos sistemas
[3858.50s - 3860.50s]:  Y en generación nuclear por supuesto, con visión al futuro
[3861.50s - 3873.50s]:  Gracias candidato Cronfley, vamos ahora con el candidato Luis Felipe Tillería, quien tiene 90 segundos para responder la interrogante de este segundo eje temático sobre eficiencia del Estado y servicios públicos
[3873.50s - 3884.50s]:  Y servicios públicos, recapitulo la pregunta, es responsabilidad del Estado prestar servicios públicos de calidad, pero en 2024 sufrimos apagones de hasta 14 horas diarias
[3885.50s - 3893.50s]:  En su gobierno revisará los tarifarios para garantizar la provisión de servicios públicos como energía eléctrica, telefonía, conectividad, entre otros
[3894.50s - 3896.50s]:  Su tiempo de 90 segundos corre a partir de este momento
[3897.50s - 3902.50s]:  Vamos a liberalizar la economía para maximizar el potencial del Ecuador
[3903.50s - 3906.50s]:  Se van todos, solo se quedan los honestos
[3907.50s - 3910.50s]:  En términos de eficiencia, vamos a eliminar la burocracia parasitaria
[3911.50s - 3915.50s]:  230 mil chupa sangre que tienen al Ecuador pobre
[3916.50s - 3920.50s]:  Utilizaremos inteligencia artificial a través de nuestro programa Tiller IA
[3921.50s - 3925.50s]:  El estatismo es una bestia con las garras metidas en todo
[3926.50s - 3930.50s]:  Es parte de un pacto mercantilista macabro entre la política y la oligarquía
[3930.50s - 3937.50s]:  Ecuador tiene el doble de petróleo que Dubái, pero estos políticos nos mantienen pobres
[3938.50s - 3942.50s]:  Ese pacto mercantilista es el que no genera empleo y nos hace migrar
[3943.50s - 3947.50s]:  Con Tillería se les acaba la pillería, solo se quedan los honestos
[3948.50s - 3951.50s]:  Por eso hermano, envíame tu currículum a Tillería.com
[3952.50s - 3956.50s]:  Ayúdame a reemplazar a las manzanas y a las bananas podridas
[3956.50s - 3961.50s]:  Conozco el primer mundo, sé que un estado pequeño y ágil es clave para el desarrollo
[3962.50s - 3968.50s]:  Hoy se gastan 3.500 millones de dólares, es decir, 10 millones de dólares diarios
[3969.50s - 3976.50s]:  Que bien pueden funcionar para 10 escuelas o para 3 hospitales o para 238 patrulleros
[3977.50s - 3983.50s]:  Vamos a resetear el sistema, los sueldos de los asambleistas a 3 salarios mínimos vitales
[3983.50s - 3985.50s]:  Con Tillería se acaba la pillería
[3986.50s - 3991.50s]:  La primera interpelación a la respuesta del candidato Luis Felipe Tillería la realizaré en 15 segundos
[3992.50s - 3995.50s]:  El candidato Juan Iván Cueva, su tiempo corre ahora candidato Cueva
[3996.50s - 4002.50s]:  Luis Felipe, has hablado de energía nuclear, yo soy un experto en energía y te quiero preguntar lo siguiente
[4003.50s - 4009.50s]:  Donde vas a instalar las plantas nucleares y que medidas ecológicas vas a tomar para que eso luego no sea una desgracia
[4010.50s - 4014.50s]:  Candidato Luis Felipe Tillería tiene 30 segundos para responder a partir de este momento
[4015.50s - 4027.50s]:  Tenemos el potencial de generar 10.000 megavatios en energía nuclear con una sola planta, es decir, 22 veces la energía que fuimos a mendigarle a Colombia
[4028.50s - 4035.50s]:  Lamentablemente el actual sistema de los políticos estatistas hacen que no podamos desarrollar todo nuestro potencial
[4035.50s - 4041.50s]:  Una planta de energía nuclear fácilmente puede quedar en el oriente y poder tener energía a muy bajo costo
[4042.50s - 4043.50s]:  Viva la libertad
[4044.50s - 4051.50s]:  Gracias candidato Tillería, su tarjeta para la segunda interpelación es de color gris al igual que el candidato Cronfle
[4052.50s - 4056.50s]:  Candidato Cronfle tiene 15 segundos para interpelar al candidato Tillería a partir de este momento
[4057.50s - 4065.50s]:  ¿Estás de acuerdo conmigo en liquidar Petro Ecuador para crear un modelo de producción petrolera eliminando las mafias?
[4066.50s - 4070.50s]:  Como se hizo en Brasil, Colombia, Argentina con propiedad y control mayoritario del estado
[4071.50s - 4076.50s]:  Gracias candidato Cronfle, candidato Juan Iván Cueva tiene 30 segundos para responder a la interpelación
[4077.50s - 4078.50s]:  Perdón, candidato Tillería
[4079.50s - 4080.50s]:  Perdón
[4081.50s - 4083.50s]:  Perdón, Tillería
[4083.50s - 4084.50s]:  Tillería
[4085.50s - 4093.50s]:  No solamente liquidar Petro Ecuador, vamos a devolvérsela a la ciudadanía a través de acciones como estas
[4094.50s - 4098.50s]:  Para que si tú quieres la puedas vender en mil, mil cien dólares o si quieres
[4099.50s - 4105.50s]:  Te esperes y lo guardes en el segundo cajón de tu casa y te esperes todos los años a recibir tus utilidades de 80 dólares
[4106.50s - 4108.50s]:  Una familia de cinco miembros recibiría 400
[4108.50s - 4112.50s]:  Antes de Navidad eso puede ser la diferencia entre tener Navidad o no
[4113.50s - 4116.50s]:  No compartimos el sistema de los social cristianos
[4117.50s - 4123.50s]:  Gracias candidato Tillería, ahora es el turno del candidato Juan Iván Cueva va a responder la primera pregunta
[4124.50s - 4128.50s]:  En 90 segundos que dice así es responsabilidad del estado prestar servicios públicos de calidad
[4129.50s - 4132.50s]:  Pero en el 2024 sufrimos apagones de hasta 14 horas diarias
[4132.50s - 4140.50s]:  En su gobierno revisará los tarifarios para garantizar la provisión de servicios públicos como energía eléctrica, telefonía o conectividad entre otros
[4141.50s - 4143.50s]:  Corre en sus 90 segundos a partir de ahora
[4144.50s - 4155.50s]:  Por supuesto que vamos a revisar el tarifario, especialmente a la industria que no necesita subsidio porque no podemos generar incentivos perversos a ellos que sí pueden invertir en su propia generación
[4155.50s - 4162.50s]:  Pero hablar de eficiencia no es solamente hablar de todo lo que están diciendo en este momento, es también saber escoger
[4163.50s - 4170.50s]:  Es por eso que me acompaña dentro de mi equipo Cristina Reyes quien sí va a estar en el Ecuador para trabajar con los ecuatorianos
[4171.50s - 4179.50s]:  Vamos a defender a nuestra patria, por eso bajaré el IVA al 12% para que puedas tener más platita en tus bolsillos
[4180.50s - 4186.50s]:  A nuestros abuelitos sí les vamos a devolver el IVA, son ellos los que más necesitan
[4187.50s - 4194.50s]:  Antes que pagar la deuda externa pagaré la deuda histórica que tenemos con los ecuatorianos, el FMI tendrá que esperar
[4195.50s - 4205.50s]:  También vamos a pagar la deuda histórica con las mujeres, bonos a las madres solteras para que aún ante la infamia de unos cuantos padres ellas siempre estén protegidas
[4206.50s - 4213.50s]:  Habrá medicinas en los hospitales, vamos a generar la canasta básica de salud que será provista por el Estado
[4214.50s - 4224.50s]:  Vamos a modernizar los servicios, se acabaron los tramitadores, el pasaporte te llegará a tu casa y el mismo día al igual que la licencia de conducir
[4225.50s - 4230.50s]:  Como lo vengo diciendo la inteligencia artificial va a reemplazar a la ineptitud actual
[4231.50s - 4238.50s]:  Gracias candidato, ahora la primera interpelación a su respuesta la va a realizar en 15 segundos, el candidato Jimmy Jairala a partir de ahora
[4239.50s - 4247.50s]:  Juan Iván, así como en mi propuesta planteo modernizar al estado desde un celular que era de madera por si acaso
[4248.50s - 4252.50s]:  ¿Tú qué propones para tecnificar el Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social?
[4253.50s - 4257.50s]:  Candidato Juan Iván Cueva tiene 30 segundos para responder esta primera interpelación ahora
[4257.50s - 4266.50s]:  Gracias Jimmy, es importantísimo poder depurar las bases de datos que existen en todo el gobierno y en todo el estado
[4267.50s - 4271.50s]:  Si nosotros tenemos bases de calidad vamos a poder tomar decisiones más adecuadas
[4272.50s - 4279.50s]:  Imagínate Jimmy un sistema computacional que esté analizando todas esas bases de datos que permita sacar los turnos inmediatamente
[4280.50s - 4284.50s]:  Para aquellas personas que necesitan en ese momento un turno en el IES
[4284.50s - 4287.50s]:  Eso lo podemos hacer con tecnología y con inteligencia artificial
[4288.50s - 4294.50s]:  Candidato Juan Iván Cueva, el sobre elegido por usted tuvo la tarjeta de color lila y coincide con el candidato Jimmy Jairala
[4295.50s - 4299.50s]:  Quien le va a realizar la segunda interpelación en 15 segundos, candidato, adelante
[4302.50s - 4310.50s]:  Candidato Juan Iván, en la modernización del estado usted contempla reducción de burocracia?
[4311.50s - 4314.50s]:  Candidato Juan Iván Cueva responde en 30 segundos ahora
[4315.50s - 4320.50s]:  Yo contemplo hacer los procesos más eficientes, la tecnología y eso hay que entenderlo
[4321.50s - 4326.50s]:  La tecnología ha venido para repotenciar las habilidades de los trabajadores
[4327.50s - 4334.50s]:  Es por eso que vamos a ser más eficientes, más rápido y sobre todo la ciudadanía va a poder tener sus trámites lo más rápido posible
[4334.50s - 4340.50s]:  Yo ya lo hice, lo hice cuando trabajé con Pepe Mujica, donde modernizamos todo el estado en todas las aristas
[4341.50s - 4345.50s]:  Siendo ahora un half de las Americas y eso quiero para el Ecuador, un half de las Americas
[4346.50s - 4352.50s]:  Gracias candidato Juan Iván Cueva, vamos a cerrar esta segunda ronda o este segundo eje
[4353.50s - 4357.50s]:  Con la intervención del candidato Daniel Novoa Asim, la pregunta planteada es
[4358.50s - 4361.50s]:  Es responsabilidad del estado prestar servicios públicos de calidad?
[4361.50s - 4365.50s]:  Pero en 2024 sufrimos apagones de hasta 14 horas diarias
[4366.50s - 4373.50s]:  En su gobierno revisará los tarifarios para garantizar la provisión de servicios públicos como energía eléctrica, telefonía, conectividad, entre otros
[4374.50s - 4377.50s]:  Tiene 90 segundos para responder, candidato Daniel Novoa
[4379.50s - 4382.50s]:  No vamos a subirle ninguna tarifa al pueblo, empezando por ahí
[4383.50s - 4386.50s]:  Segundo, veo que hay un total desconocimiento de lo que este gobierno ha hecho
[4387.50s - 4390.50s]:  Para nuevas propuestas uno tiene que entender qué es lo que está pasando ahora
[4391.50s - 4397.50s]:  El 2013-2017 trata exactamente de eso, eliminamos los subsidios a las industrias grandes y a las mineras
[4398.50s - 4404.50s]:  También, otra cosa que hemos hecho y confirmado esta semana es que en salud
[4405.50s - 4411.50s]:  Hemos firmado un acuerdo con Google y con Healthbird, para la inteligencia artificial que tanto se habla ya la vamos a hacer
[4412.50s - 4417.50s]:  Y lo estamos haciendo en este gobierno, de esa manera volvemos ágil al estado y lo volvemos eficiente pero con acciones
[4418.50s - 4421.50s]:  En energía, de nuevo, total desconocimiento de lo que está pasando
[4422.50s - 4429.50s]:  Nosotros recuperamos en 500 megawatts el parque termoeléctrico el cual no había sido mantenido por el gobierno pasado ni el anterior
[4430.50s - 4433.50s]:  Trajimos tres barcasas con una adicional de 300 megawatts
[4434.50s - 4436.50s]:  Adicional a eso, dejaron botado Toachi y Pilatón
[4437.50s - 4442.50s]:  Bueno, terminamos el proyecto de Toachi y Pilatón que genera 210 megawatts adicionales
[4442.50s - 4447.50s]:  El proyecto también de Cardenillo, del cual se habló aquí, no cuesta 6.000 millones de dólares señores
[4448.50s - 4455.50s]:  Cuesta 600 millones de dólares y va a producir en promedio unos 500 megawatts adicionales y hasta el informe final y lo vamos a concesionar
[4456.50s - 4458.50s]:  O hacerlo de una manera de APP
[4459.50s - 4463.50s]:  Y en educación, ya dimos 110 mil becas, continuaremos con nuestro programa de becas
[4472.50s - 4481.50s]:  A ver Daniel, hablas de eficiencia pero nos siguen robando y matando negocios quebrados y miles de empleos perdidos por tus apagones
[4482.50s - 4487.50s]:  ¿Por qué no cobras los 93 millones de la corporación Novoa o mejor dicho, ¿por qué no pagas?
[4488.50s - 4492.50s]:  El diálogo de Daniel Novoa tiene 30 segundos para responder a partir de este momento
[4493.50s - 4500.50s]:  Señores, nosotros vamos a volver eficiente el Estado, vamos a invertir en energía nuclear, vamos a invertir también en energía eólica
[4501.50s - 4504.50s]:  Del cual ya hemos dado más de 300 megas en licencias, con inversión privada
[4505.50s - 4510.50s]:  Porque nosotros sí estamos abiertos a la inversión internacional privada
[4511.50s - 4518.50s]:  Y mantener las cuentas en orden y cumplir con las deudas es lo que también da seguridad jurídica, así va a haber tranquilidad para todos
[4519.50s - 4525.50s]:  Daniel Novoa, sin el color de su tarjeta es similar al del candidato Jorge Escala, es decir, se va a repetir la interpelación
[4526.50s - 4530.50s]:  Candidato Escala tiene 15 segundos para interpelar al candidato Daniel Novoa, corre el tiempo ahora
[4531.50s - 4546.50s]:  A ver Daniel, en la línea de defender la naturaleza y la vida, aplicarías, realizarías las concesiones mineras, aplicarías a las concesiones mineras unas auditorías para defender el agua y los...
[4547.50s - 4551.50s]:  Gracias candidato Escala, tiene 30 segundos para responder el candidato Daniel Novoa, así
[4552.50s - 4560.50s]:  Cualquier explotación minera o petrolera tiene que regirse bajo las normas internacionales, ambientales
[4561.50s - 4565.50s]:  Debemos de proteger el agua, uno de nuestros bienes más apreciados como Estado y de la gente
[4566.50s - 4574.50s]:  Y debemos también generar empleo, pero nunca asustando la inversión extranjera, que es la que va a generar empleo masivo en este país
[4575.50s - 4580.50s]:  Gracias candidatos, de esta manera finalizamos el segundo eje temático de Ecuador Debate 2025
[4581.50s - 4584.50s]:  En este instante damos paso a nuestra segunda pausa informativa
[4588.50s - 4592.50s]:  Ya los candidatos recibieron sus sobres con los respectivos colores, mas adelante los van a abrir
[4593.50s - 4597.50s]:  Ahora vamos a dar inicio al tercer eje que es el crecimiento económico y generación de empleo, arrancamos
[4598.50s - 4604.50s]:  Aquí si abrimos el sobre obviamente de la pregunta, vincular este tercer eje temático, tenemos acá el sobre cerrado
[4605.50s - 4609.50s]:  Que fue debidamente certificado por el notario que nos está acompañando esta noche
[4611.50s - 4617.50s]:  Candidato Henry Cucalon, apenas tres de cada diez ecuatorianos tienen un empleo adecuado según el INEC
[4618.50s - 4623.50s]:  Al final de su gobierno, ¿Cuántos ecuatorianos tendrán un empleo adecuado y en que sectores de la economía?
[4624.50s - 4626.50s]:  Tiene 90 segundos para responder a partir de este momento
[4627.50s - 4634.50s]:  Vamos a aprender los motores de la economía de la mano del sector privado, quien da nueve de cada diez empleos
[4635.50s - 4638.50s]:  Y para eso vamos a un cambio radical
[4639.50s - 4646.50s]:  Primero, trabajo por horas con protección social, porque las actuales normas arcaicas perjudican
[4687.50s - 4700.58s]:  Tienes que acercarte a los beneficios de la economía, porque el
[4701.50s - 4715.50s]:  Tienes que acercarte a las tasas de empleo, donde la empresa privada va a dar un modelo eficiente y no eficiente como el actual
[4715.50s - 4722.50s]:  Thank you candidate Cucalon. The first intervention to your answer will be done in 15 seconds by candidate Daniel Novoa Asin.
[4722.50s - 4724.50s]:  From this moment on. Candidate.
[4728.50s - 4732.50s]:  Mr. Cucalon, do you agree to give up the Sacha field?
[4732.50s - 4735.50s]:  Candidate Cucalon has 30 seconds to respond.
[4735.50s - 4741.50s]:  Are you or are you doing? If I am talking about total opening up to the oil sector, it is that yes,
[4741.50s - 4745.50s]:  opening up to private investment that will generate more employment.
[4745.50s - 4754.50s]:  Candidates, you have 8 envelopes that were chosen by you at random at the beginning of this theme axis.
[4754.50s - 4757.50s]:  The third one contains color cards.
[4757.50s - 4763.50s]:  The candidates with colors that coincide and interact with each other in the corresponding interpellation in the second.
[4763.50s - 4769.50s]:  Please show on the screen if you can raise the cards. Please, the colors coincide.
[4769.50s - 4771.50s]:  Thank you.
[4771.50s - 4775.50s]:  Candidate Cucalon has a color that coincides with candidate Henrico Roffle.
[4775.50s - 4780.50s]:  Candidate Henrico Roffle has 15 seconds to intervene with candidate Cucalon from this moment on.
[4780.50s - 4786.50s]:  Thousands of Ecuadorian families arrive at the end of the month while taxes continue to drain their pockets.
[4786.50s - 4794.50s]:  Do you agree to reduce the IBA to 12% and even reach 10% and eliminate it from all basic cash?
[4794.50s - 4797.50s]:  Candidate Cucalon, in 30 seconds your answer.
[4797.50s - 4800.50s]:  Currently, almost all basic cash is not paid to IBA.
[4800.50s - 4805.50s]:  I will reduce and eliminate ICD, which is a punishment for income tax.
[4805.50s - 4809.50s]:  I will stimulate with incentives and lower the tax on income.
[4809.50s - 4812.50s]:  We will also lower the tax on special consumption.
[4812.50s - 4818.50s]:  And in the case of IBA, which is already budgeted and I have to pay salaries of the first month of government,
[4818.50s - 4824.50s]:  with the fiscal discipline, cutting the waste that the Ecuadorian state has,
[4824.50s - 4828.50s]:  I will lower it in the percentage that corresponds to the president of the republic.
[4828.50s - 4830.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Henrico Calon.
[4830.50s - 4834.50s]:  Now it is the turn of candidate Jimmy Jairala who will answer the following question in 90 seconds.
[4834.50s - 4836.50s]:  I will read it again and it says so.
[4836.50s - 4841.50s]:  Only three out of every ten Ecuadorians have an adequate job according to INEC.
[4841.50s - 4848.50s]:  At the end of your government, candidate, how many Ecuadorians will have an adequate job and in which sectors of the economy?
[4848.50s - 4851.50s]:  It runs its 90 seconds from now.
[4852.50s - 4857.50s]:  They will have it in all sectors of the economy because we are dying to be next to the source.
[4857.50s - 4866.50s]:  Under the ground that we are stepping on, there are around 40 billion dollars of reserves between oil and gas.
[4866.50s - 4874.50s]:  They must be exploited with modern technology, respecting the environmental environment to generate wealth.
[4874.50s - 4877.50s]:  We cannot continue depending on debt.
[4877.50s - 4887.50s]:  Next year, the state budget will be compromised, at least in a quarter, to honor capital and interests.
[4887.50s - 4897.50s]:  We must also re-sign the external debt and negotiate with international creditors a moratorium possibility,
[4897.50s - 4901.50s]:  which does not mean that I do not want to pay you, it means that I will agree with you,
[4901.50s - 4904.50s]:  that you give me a respite to be able to boost the economy.
[4904.50s - 4908.50s]:  If we do not understand that we must exploit those 40 billion dollars that are under the ground,
[4908.50s - 4918.50s]:  it turns out that we can all offer and say mass here, but it is not possible because the Ecuadorian state is at this moment strangled
[4918.50s - 4926.50s]:  and has little space to produce, generate resources, do public work.
[4926.50s - 4933.50s]:  The money is here under the ground and I commit myself, because I have the political will to do so,
[4933.50s - 4936.50s]:  to make that decision. I will do it.
[4936.50s - 4940.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Jairala. The first interpellation to your answer will be made in 15 seconds.
[4940.50s - 4943.50s]:  Candidate Juan Iván Cueva, run time.
[4943.50s - 4948.50s]:  Jimmy, in my defense plan of Ecuador, the field is a priority.
[4948.50s - 4954.50s]:  Would you integrate technology to give added value to the products that are exported from Ecuador today?
[4954.50s - 4959.50s]:  Candidate Jimmy Jairala has 30 seconds to respond from now on.
[4959.50s - 4965.50s]:  Not only that, Juan Iván, the field is aging, nobody wants to work in the field anymore,
[4965.50s - 4967.50s]:  because productivity has dropped.
[4967.50s - 4978.50s]:  We must work on a certified seed pilot plan to increase productivity and also try to eliminate the intermediation.
[4978.50s - 4985.50s]:  The intermediation is the greatest punishment that small and medium-sized producers have.
[4985.50s - 4990.50s]:  We are going to rescue the field because we are going to return the eye to the agro.
[4990.50s - 4995.50s]:  Candidate Jimmy Jairala, according to the choice of you, Alazar, the green color,
[4995.50s - 5001.50s]:  coincides with you, candidate Tabaki, who will make the interpellation in 15 seconds from now on.
[5001.50s - 5008.50s]:  Candidate Jairala, our young people are calling for work, they graduate and ask for experience.
[5008.50s - 5011.50s]:  What are you going to do for the private company and entrepreneurs?
[5011.50s - 5014.50s]:  How are you going to encourage them to hire our young people?
[5014.50s - 5017.50s]:  Candidate Jairala, respond in 30 seconds.
[5017.50s - 5025.50s]:  I would start because dual education is a policy of the state, students from the last two years of school,
[5025.50s - 5034.50s]:  who are trained in private companies, who would receive a contribution, a tax exchange bonus.
[5034.50s - 5040.50s]:  And also with the amount of resources that we are going to extract from the 40 billion in which I speak,
[5040.50s - 5044.50s]:  we are going to have a lot of money for programs in benefit of young people.
[5044.50s - 5048.50s]:  Thank you candidate Jairala. I am now going with candidate Francesco Tabaki,
[5048.50s - 5050.50s]:  recapitulating the question.
[5050.50s - 5054.50s]:  Only three out of every ten Ecuadorians have an adequate job according to INEC.
[5054.50s - 5060.50s]:  At the end of your government, how many Ecuadorians will have an adequate job and in which sectors of the economy?
[5060.50s - 5063.50s]:  90 seconds to answer candidate Francesco Tabaki.
[5063.50s - 5065.50s]:  And the data is correct.
[5065.50s - 5070.50s]:  We have been used to all problems being solved with packages or taxes.
[5070.50s - 5073.50s]:  Public debt, taxes, insecurity, taxes.
[5073.50s - 5079.50s]:  The best option is not to charge taxes to the middle class.
[5079.50s - 5082.50s]:  And the second thing is to start producing and generating employment.
[5082.50s - 5087.50s]:  Where? Looking at the ground, what is down there, oil, energy and mining.
[5087.50s - 5093.50s]:  Open the doors to private companies and foreign investment, regulated and controlled by the state.
[5093.50s - 5098.50s]:  A little bit higher, the public work so forgotten, roads and bridges.
[5098.50s - 5105.50s]:  Concession them also to private companies and foreign investment, regulated and controlled by the state.
[5105.50s - 5111.50s]:  And a little bit higher, the productive sectors, agriculture 4.0.
[5111.50s - 5118.50s]:  We are going to make an agricultural transformation where we are going to invest 800 million dollars.
[5118.50s - 5126.50s]:  With a 4.0 agriculture that goes from the bottom up, from the smallest to the medium.
[5126.50s - 5131.50s]:  With systematization, ground mechanization, irrigation, with energy.
[5131.50s - 5139.50s]:  This is going to make the small and poor producers never have to depend on the price of their land.
[5139.50s - 5144.50s]:  We are going to make a sustainable system that has to worry about its costs.
[5144.50s - 5147.50s]:  That is going to make it more useful.
[5147.50s - 5150.50s]:  We have to do this as soon as possible.
[5150.50s - 5154.50s]:  With a hard hand, a fair hand and a smart hand.
[5154.50s - 5159.50s]:  Thank you candidate. The first question will be answered in 15 seconds by candidate Jorge Escala.
[5159.50s - 5161.50s]:  Starting now.
[5161.50s - 5170.50s]:  You and Daniel lost the question of the hiring by hour in the popular consultation.
[5170.50s - 5176.50s]:  Would you support our proposal to guarantee the stability of the labor, the dignified wages and the labor rights?
[5176.50s - 5180.50s]:  30 seconds to answer, candidate Francesco Tabaki.
[5180.50s - 5183.50s]:  Candidate, I have not lost anything.
[5183.50s - 5189.50s]:  I am here because I want to generate employment, work, equality for all citizens.
[5189.50s - 5192.50s]:  Young people and not so young people.
[5192.50s - 5200.50s]:  Women, mothers, producers, farmers, those who have not been taken into account, the marginalized, the forgotten.
[5200.50s - 5203.50s]:  The fight is not between us candidates.
[5203.50s - 5212.50s]:  We are against adversities, against the lack of opportunities to get this country ahead and have the Ecuador that we all deserve.
[5213.50s - 5218.50s]:  Candidate Jimmy Jairala has the green envelope, like candidate Tabaki.
[5218.50s - 5223.50s]:  Candidate Jairala has 15 seconds for this second question to candidate Tabaki.
[5223.50s - 5232.50s]:  Candidate Tabaki, as I propose to exploit the 40 billion dollars we have under the ground between oil and gas.
[5232.50s - 5235.50s]:  What do you think you will do with Petro Ecuador?
[5235.50s - 5239.50s]:  Thank you candidate Francesco Tabaki. 30 seconds, run the time.
[5239.50s - 5246.50s]:  The first thing I have to do is open the doors for everyone who can work, to come to work.
[5246.50s - 5250.50s]:  Not only in oil, but also in mining, in energy.
[5250.50s - 5259.50s]:  We have seen how Peru has 300 billion dollars that they enter it and we only have 30 billion.
[5259.50s - 5264.50s]:  Do you know why? Because we let the illegal sit in the mining chair.
[5264.50s - 5267.50s]:  We are not going to let illegal sit in the mining chair.
[5267.50s - 5270.50s]:  It is the time to break the circle.
[5270.50s - 5272.50s]:  Thank you candidate Tabaki.
[5272.50s - 5274.50s]:  Candidate Jorge Escalés, your turn.
[5274.50s - 5280.50s]:  We are going to continue with you precisely and answer the question of the axis 3 economic growth and generation of employment.
[5280.50s - 5285.50s]:  It points out that only three out of every ten Ecuadorians have an adequate job according to INEC.
[5285.50s - 5291.50s]:  At the end of your government, how many Ecuadorians will have an adequate job and in which sectors of the economy?
[5291.50s - 5293.50s]:  We are going to continue with you.
[5293.50s - 5298.50s]:  It is the time of production, it is the time of employment and of the salary.
[5298.50s - 5310.50s]:  We will create 500,000 jobs, of which 250,000 will be for youth employment, tripling the investment in public work.
[5310.50s - 5316.50s]:  We will open a line of credit for women, young people, peasants, merchants and entrepreneurs.
[5316.50s - 5320.50s]:  We will lower the interest rate of the Chulquera Bank.
[5320.50s - 5327.50s]:  In our government, pre-professional practices will be paid for for our young people.
[5327.50s - 5334.50s]:  We will raise the salary to $570 to improve the lives of families.
[5334.50s - 5345.50s]:  We will deliver a productive bonus and we will also guarantee the reduction of tax incentives to guarantee this salary increase in favor of small and medium-sized companies.
[5346.50s - 5354.50s]:  We will lower the interest rate to 10% to alleviate the crisis of Ecuadorians.
[5354.50s - 5356.50s]:  This is possible.
[5356.50s - 5363.50s]:  We will create the migrant bank so that the remittances have zero costs in their transactions.
[5363.50s - 5368.50s]:  We will agree on the moratorium on the payment of the external debt for four years.
[5368.50s - 5373.50s]:  This way we will recover around $35,000 million.
[5373.50s - 5383.50s]:  This will solve the problem of employment, work, economic reactivation, security and above all, first of all, life.
[5383.50s - 5385.50s]:  We are running out of time.
[5385.50s - 5388.50s]:  Candidate Escala, the first interpellation will be made by candidate Enrique Calón.
[5388.50s - 5389.50s]:  You have 15 seconds.
[5389.50s - 5390.50s]:  Time is running out.
[5390.50s - 5395.50s]:  Ecuadorians are fed up with spending their taxes when there are so many needs.
[5395.50s - 5401.50s]:  Candidate, what will you do to prevent the state of propaganda that Correa had and that the current regime has?
[5401.50s - 5403.50s]:  Candidate Jorge Escala, you have 30 seconds.
[5403.50s - 5409.50s]:  You and Daniel defend tax evasors.
[5409.50s - 5413.50s]:  There is no difference between what Daniel does and what Cucalón proposes.
[5413.50s - 5419.50s]:  They are kneeling before the International Monetary Fund to sell to the country.
[5419.50s - 5429.50s]:  We will defend the state heritage of all Ecuadorians to finance health, education, free access to universities
[5429.50s - 5434.50s]:  and to create 250,000 jobs for our young people.
[5434.50s - 5440.50s]:  Candidate Jorge Escala, your color card is the same as that of candidate Luis Felipe Tillería, which is black.
[5440.50s - 5446.50s]:  Now it corresponds to the candidate, precisely, the 15 seconds of interpellation.
[5446.50s - 5448.50s]:  Time is running out, candidate Tillería.
[5448.50s - 5454.50s]:  I propose a bullet train that takes off from Río Bamba to Guayaquil in 1 hour and 50 minutes to improve competitiveness.
[5454.50s - 5458.50s]:  The first train in the world was inaugurated in England in 1825.
[5458.50s - 5460.50s]:  We have 200 years of delay.
[5460.50s - 5465.50s]:  Candidate, please, you have to interpell candidate Escala with respect to the answer he pointed out.
[5465.50s - 5467.50s]:  You have two seconds, you have two seconds left.
[5467.50s - 5469.50s]:  Do you think it's enough and support us?
[5470.50s - 5475.50s]:  Candidate Jorge Escala, please, when I mention it, time is running out from now on.
[5475.50s - 5482.50s]:  We will charge the debt to the big tax evasors, especially to you, Daniel,
[5482.50s - 5493.50s]:  and all the resources, more than 11 billion dollars that we will charge to the big tax evasors will serve for public work and for state infrastructure.
[5494.50s - 5496.50s]:  Thank you candidate Escala.
[5496.50s - 5498.50s]:  Now we go with candidate Henry Cronfleck-Ozaya.
[5498.50s - 5500.50s]:  I recap the question.
[5500.50s - 5504.50s]:  Only three out of every ten Ecuadorians have an adequate job according to INEC.
[5504.50s - 5511.50s]:  At the end of your government, candidate Cronfleck, how many Ecuadorians will have an adequate job and in which sectors of the economy?
[5511.50s - 5514.50s]:  You have 90 seconds, time is running out.
[5514.50s - 5516.50s]:  It's impossible to determine that.
[5516.50s - 5518.50s]:  It will depend on the actions we take.
[5518.50s - 5521.50s]:  But you can say that employment is not generated by decree.
[5521.50s - 5525.50s]:  You have to put money in the pocket of the Ecuadorian family so that they can buy,
[5525.50s - 5528.50s]:  companies can grow and you have to multiply public work.
[5528.50s - 5530.50s]:  This is how private and public jobs are created.
[5530.50s - 5535.50s]:  But what happens today is that today you work more and more and you get less.
[5535.50s - 5538.50s]:  If you spend more than you have, you break.
[5538.50s - 5545.50s]:  But if the state spends more than it has, it raises taxes, it owes you and you also break.
[5545.50s - 5546.50s]:  That's the problem.
[5546.50s - 5548.50s]:  So that's what we have to stop.
[5548.50s - 5549.50s]:  The conclusion is simple.
[5549.50s - 5553.50s]:  They work for governments, governors and not for the people.
[5553.50s - 5557.50s]:  Do you remember when I did the campaign, your job is for your family?
[5557.50s - 5566.50s]:  Do you remember when Correa wanted to impose the law of inheritance and the law of plusvalia and take 75% of what you have?
[5566.50s - 5568.50s]:  Well, we stopped that.
[5568.50s - 5573.50s]:  Now 250,000 jobs were lost in this government with the shutdowns.
[5573.50s - 5581.50s]:  Investment fell 12.2%, PIP 2.2%, extreme poverty 3%, employment fell 9%.
[5581.50s - 5583.50s]:  We need to do the following.
[5583.50s - 5585.50s]:  First axis, pocket, money in your pocket.
[5585.50s - 5595.50s]:  Reduction of the IBA by 12% and 10%, zero IBA in the basic basket and medical supplies, agricultural tools and supplies for taxis, buses and trucks and artisanal fishermen.
[5595.50s - 5596.50s]:  Zero taxes on tourism.
[5596.50s - 5603.50s]:  We will create a fund of 700 million dollars for young people and we will keep the gas pump subsidy.
[5603.50s - 5604.50s]:  And we will keep...
[5604.50s - 5606.50s]:  Your time is up candidate Cronfle.
[5606.50s - 5610.50s]:  Now Luis Felipe Tilleria will be the candidate who will intervene in 15 seconds.
[5610.50s - 5612.50s]:  Your time is running now candidate Tilleria.
[5612.50s - 5615.50s]:  You have been an assemblyman for some time.
[5615.50s - 5619.50s]:  Unfortunately, the laws that have been made have not generated employment.
[5619.50s - 5623.50s]:  Do you think it is the fault of your inefficiency or Rafael's?
[5624.50s - 5625.50s]:  Thank you candidate Tilleria.
[5625.50s - 5627.50s]:  Candidate Cronfle, 30 seconds.
[5627.50s - 5628.50s]:  Your time is running.
[5628.50s - 5632.50s]:  Employment is generated when the economy is dynamized.
[5632.50s - 5634.50s]:  Not through laws only.
[5634.50s - 5636.50s]:  You can give incentives to companies.
[5636.50s - 5640.50s]:  But if the economy does not grow, as the gross domestic product fell here,
[5640.50s - 5646.50s]:  0.7% as determined by the World Bank, there is no way to generate employment.
[5646.50s - 5648.50s]:  That is why I am aiming to grow the economy.
[5648.50s - 5654.50s]:  I want to create a cheap credit for the fishing, artisan, livestock, and agro-breed sectors in general.
[5654.50s - 5656.50s]:  And increase the salary to 600 dollars.
[5657.50s - 5658.50s]:  Thank you candidate.
[5658.50s - 5661.50s]:  Now, for the coincidence of colors, the orange color,
[5661.50s - 5665.50s]:  candidate Henry Cucalon will intervene.
[5665.50s - 5667.50s]:  In 15 seconds candidate Cucalon.
[5668.50s - 5670.50s]:  I am a dollarization convent.
[5670.50s - 5673.50s]:  And I believe in eliminating the Ecuador Central Bank.
[5673.50s - 5676.50s]:  Candidate, would you eliminate the Ecuador Central Bank?
[5676.50s - 5680.50s]:  Candidate Henry Cronfle has 30 seconds to respond from this moment.
[5681.50s - 5685.50s]:  No, I would not eliminate it, but I would put a shirt of strength.
[5685.50s - 5688.50s]:  So that only what you have to do is dedicated.
[5688.50s - 5692.50s]:  That is to control that the dollarization has the parameters that are needed.
[5692.50s - 5698.50s]:  Therefore, the transactions that are made in foreign trade go through the Central Bank and are extremely necessary.
[5698.50s - 5700.50s]:  The Central Bank would maintain it.
[5700.50s - 5702.50s]:  Thank you candidate Cronfle.
[5702.50s - 5707.50s]:  Now it is the turn of candidate Luis Felipe Tilleria who will answer this question in 90 seconds.
[5707.50s - 5713.50s]:  We read the question to each of the candidates because this is how the regulation of the National Debate Committee is established.
[5713.50s - 5718.50s]:  The question says so, just three out of every ten Ecuadorians have an adequate job according to INEC.
[5718.50s - 5724.50s]:  At the end of your government, how many Ecuadorians will have an adequate job and in which sectors of the economy?
[5724.50s - 5726.50s]:  It has 90 seconds from now.
[5726.50s - 5729.50s]:  More jobs than people.
[5729.50s - 5731.50s]:  More jobs than people.
[5731.50s - 5734.50s]:  With a new constitution that embraces the ideas of freedom.
[5734.50s - 5741.50s]:  Ideas of freedom that I see that now in the last three weeks are defended by many of the panelists here.
[5741.50s - 5746.50s]:  Even the migrant bank for which we have been fighting for the last 12 years.
[5746.50s - 5748.50s]:  We will liberalize the economy.
[5748.50s - 5750.50s]:  We will return you Petro Ecuador.
[5750.50s - 5756.50s]:  We will be an international financial center, the cradle of 400 banks, including the migrant bank.
[5756.50s - 5761.50s]:  For there to be taxes in that competition law, 3, 4% of annual interest,
[5761.50s - 5766.50s]:  30 years as it happens in England, in Europe, in the United States.
[5766.50s - 5771.50s]:  Amazon, eBay or Temu will come to make a regional distribution hub.
[5771.50s - 5776.50s]:  And our young people will create the new Apple, Facebook or Google.
[5776.50s - 5782.50s]:  We will give them 8 GB of free internet so that they can work in the best companies in the world.
[5782.50s - 5785.50s]:  In Ecuador there are 25 million hectares.
[5785.50s - 5791.50s]:  Unfortunately, we only produce 5 million hectares because they have all been governing in the last 40 years.
[5791.50s - 5797.50s]:  What we want is to provide for irrigation and financing to produce 15 million hectares.
[5797.50s - 5801.50s]:  And so, by that rule of three, triplicate employment.
[5801.50s - 5809.50s]:  It seems strange to third world politicians, but your migrant family knows that in the first world there are more jobs than people.
[5809.50s - 5810.50s]:  That's why we go there.
[5810.50s - 5816.50s]:  And finally, I will return you, Petro Ecuador, without political intermediaries, your oil in your pockets.
[5816.50s - 5818.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Tillería.
[5818.50s - 5821.50s]:  The first interpellation to your answer will be made in 15 seconds.
[5821.50s - 5823.50s]:  Candidate Francesco Tabaki, run the time.
[5823.50s - 5831.50s]:  Candidate Tillería, Ecuador is a country as rich as all the rich countries you have in your cartel.
[5831.50s - 5835.50s]:  The difference is that we have a currency called biodiversity.
[5835.50s - 5839.50s]:  What are you going to do so that Ecuador can benefit economically without...
[5840.50s - 5843.50s]:  Candidate Luis Felipe Tillería, you have 30 seconds.
[5843.50s - 5844.50s]:  Answer now.
[5844.50s - 5852.50s]:  I am the only candidate on the panel who is currently the councilman of the city of London and a member of the environmental health committee.
[5852.50s - 5861.50s]:  I know how sovereign bonds indexed to sustainability work, in which Chile has collected 20,000 million since 2019.
[5861.50s - 5864.50s]:  That is equivalent to a third of all external debt.
[5864.50s - 5872.50s]:  We know what the solutions are because we have lived in the first world, no more third world, embracing the ideas of freedom.
[5872.50s - 5874.50s]:  Ecuador, heading to the first world.
[5874.50s - 5880.50s]:  Candidate Luis Felipe Tillería, your color card coincides with candidate Jorge Escala, which is black.
[5880.50s - 5882.50s]:  You are going to interpellate candidate Escala in 15 seconds.
[5882.50s - 5883.50s]:  Run the time.
[5883.50s - 5887.50s]:  Novoa ruined the economy of the country.
[5887.50s - 5890.50s]:  It raised the basket to 800 dollars.
[5890.50s - 5898.50s]:  Would you support our proposal to reduce the IVA by 10% to return the purchasing capacity to families?
[5898.50s - 5902.50s]:  Candidate Luis Felipe Tillería, please answer, 30 seconds.
[5902.50s - 5905.50s]:  We are much more optimistic.
[5905.50s - 5908.50s]:  With a good collection we can deepen it.
[5908.50s - 5913.50s]:  In the four years of government, we will not suddenly lower the IVA by 8%.
[5913.50s - 5918.50s]:  This statism has the economy on its knees.
[5918.50s - 5922.50s]:  We are going to reset the system so that Ecuador can head to the first world.
[5922.50s - 5924.50s]:  Thank you candidate Tillería.
[5924.50s - 5926.50s]:  We are now going to the candidate Juan Iván Cueva.
[5926.50s - 5932.50s]:  The question is, only three out of every ten Ecuadorians have an adequate job according to INEC.
[5932.50s - 5938.50s]:  At the end of your government, how many Ecuadorians will have an adequate job and in which sectors of the economy?
[5938.50s - 5941.50s]:  You have 90 seconds to answer from this moment.
[5941.50s - 5945.50s]:  Hour and a half talking about Correa and Novoa.
[5946.50s - 5949.50s]:  I am also in the mood for all this.
[5949.50s - 5953.50s]:  The economic crisis has destroyed everything in the country.
[5953.50s - 5956.50s]:  The energy crisis has been the one that has driven it.
[5956.50s - 5964.50s]:  That is why we are going to implement 900 million dollars in the generation of 750 megawatts.
[5964.50s - 5971.50s]:  In what? 500 megawatts in solar energy, 200 in biomass, 50 in wind energy.
[5971.50s - 5977.50s]:  This way we will be able to recover the 249,000 jobs that have been lost.
[5977.50s - 5980.50s]:  But before that, you know what a megawatt is?
[5980.50s - 5984.50s]:  A megawatt is the light for a year of 600 families.
[5984.50s - 5990.50s]:  We are going to invest 1,000 million dollars in reactivating and energizing the economy.
[5990.50s - 5999.50s]:  Private public alliances, there will be jobs for doctors, nurses, engineers, artisans, guards, workers and more.
[5999.50s - 6002.50s]:  The countryside will have unprecedented support.
[6002.50s - 6011.50s]:  With artificial intelligence we are going to create a predictive platform for rain, sales and cultivation.
[6012.50s - 6015.50s]:  All this is feasible, believe me.
[6015.50s - 6017.50s]:  All this is feasible.
[6017.50s - 6021.50s]:  But we cannot make mistakes in our votes anymore.
[6021.50s - 6024.50s]:  Only by not taking more photos.
[6026.50s - 6027.50s]:  Thank you candidate Juan Ivan Cueva.
[6027.50s - 6032.50s]:  The first interpellation to your answer will be done in 15 seconds by candidate Jimmy Gerala Avalaza.
[6032.50s - 6033.50s]:  Run the time.
[6034.50s - 6043.50s]:  Juan Ivan, just as we propose to activate a dual education plan, how do you plan to generate jobs for young Ecuadorians?
[6044.50s - 6047.50s]:  In 30 seconds candidate Juan Ivan Cueva, your answer.
[6048.50s - 6050.50s]:  Fiscal incentives, Jimmy.
[6050.50s - 6051.50s]:  Fiscal incentives.
[6051.50s - 6052.50s]:  To whom?
[6052.50s - 6060.50s]:  To all the companies that help us with the goal of creating young employment, employment for young people.
[6060.50s - 6067.50s]:  For the new graduates, they will have a reduction of up to five points in the tax on rent.
[6067.50s - 6075.50s]:  We are going to encourage them so that the learning curve that a young person has can be supported by the companies.
[6075.50s - 6084.50s]:  According to the color match, the brown color, candidate Daniel Novoazin will interpell in 15 seconds candidate Juan Ivan Cueva from this moment.
[6085.50s - 6098.50s]:  Candidate Cueva, you are saying that we did the right thing in tax reform, in tax reductions in the tax on rent for the generation of young employment between 18 and 29 years old, as well as graduates from public universities.
[6099.50s - 6101.50s]:  30 seconds to answer candidate Cueva.
[6101.50s - 6105.50s]:  There is a big difference between saying and doing.
[6105.50s - 6107.50s]:  What is missing is doing.
[6107.50s - 6112.50s]:  And doing can be demonstrated when someone is inept and cannot achieve it.
[6112.50s - 6123.50s]:  Many of you can generate many promises of campaign, but the point, the point that differentiates you from someone who is worth it is precisely that, doing.
[6123.50s - 6125.50s]:  And that has been missing from you.
[6125.50s - 6126.50s]:  Thank you candidate Cueva.
[6126.50s - 6127.50s]:  Thank you candidate Cueva.
[6127.50s - 6131.50s]:  Now it is the turn of candidate Daniel Novoazin who will answer the next question in 90 seconds.
[6131.50s - 6133.50s]:  I am going to read it again.
[6133.50s - 6138.50s]:  Candidate who says that only three out of every ten Ecuadorians have an adequate job according to INEC.
[6138.50s - 6147.50s]:  At the end of your government, how many Ecuadorians will have an adequate job and in which sectors of the economy do you run your 90 seconds from now on?
[6147.50s - 6154.50s]:  Ecuadorians, to govern you need to understand first, then say and finally do.
[6154.50s - 6156.50s]:  What do you need to understand?
[6156.50s - 6160.50s]:  That there are many things that are already on the way, but it takes longer.
[6160.50s - 6163.50s]:  Tax deduction is a reality for the generation of young people.
[6163.50s - 6170.50s]:  We, contrary to the figures that have been said here, and thank God you can see it in fact checking on the pages that we mention,
[6170.50s - 6177.50s]:  we received a state with 4,600 million dollars in payment delay from the government of the meeting.
[6177.50s - 6184.50s]:  We have controlled inflation, 1.7%, so what they talk about the basic basket does not match the numbers.
[6184.50s - 6191.50s]:  We have also increased sales by 2.2%, we have increased exports by 12% as a nation,
[6191.50s - 6196.50s]:  and we are going to end the year with a minimum growth because it was a year of correction.
[6196.50s - 6201.50s]:  It was a year in which we could settle the bases to get ahead from there.
[6201.50s - 6205.50s]:  I repeat, understand to be able to say and to be able to do.
[6205.50s - 6209.50s]:  There are many cases here of people who seem to have read the book but did not understand it.
[6209.50s - 6213.50s]:  Another essential thing, we need an assembly that makes sense.
[6213.50s - 6221.50s]:  Part of the economy is also the struggle against the washing of assets, against drug trafficking, against corruption.
[6221.50s - 6227.50s]:  And here, you can see that some were in favor of eliminating the anti-cruelty law.
[6227.50s - 6234.50s]:  We are going to cut down on corruption, generate a million jobs at the end of the next period, and give progress to the country.
[6234.50s - 6238.50s]:  Candidate Novoa, the first interpellation to your answer will be done in 15 seconds.
[6238.50s - 6241.50s]:  Candidate Henry Kronfle from now on.
[6242.50s - 6251.50s]:  Daniel, do you agree with me on a rate of interest that is not greater than 5% for the agricultural, artisan and fishing sectors
[6251.50s - 6255.50s]:  and to strongly reduce the rates of interest of credit cards?
[6255.50s - 6259.50s]:  Candidate Daniel Novoa has 30 seconds to answer now.
[6259.50s - 6266.50s]:  I think we should correct excessive taxes and help the agro, even with lower rates.
[6266.50s - 6277.50s]:  But we should also lend money for projects that make sense and help with technical assistance, with soil studies to our farmers, with projects to our entrepreneurs.
[6277.50s - 6286.50s]:  That is essential. Lending money to very low interest, but also in projects in which the state helps that entrepreneur or that farmer to get ahead.
[6286.50s - 6294.50s]:  Candidate Daniel Novoa, according to the choice you made, Alasar, at the beginning of this axis, your color card coincides with the candidate Cueva,
[6294.50s - 6299.50s]:  who will perform the second interpellation in 15 seconds from now on.
[6299.50s - 6304.50s]:  Daniel, the energy crisis has generated 249,000 unemployment.
[6304.50s - 6307.50s]:  I want to ask you what all Ecuadorians ask.
[6307.50s - 6314.50s]:  Why did you make late decisions? Why did you delay? Why do you still live in the bubble and do not see the reality of the country?
[6314.50s - 6318.50s]:  Candidate Daniel Novoa, answer in 30 seconds now.
[6318.50s - 6320.50s]:  Again we see numbers that make no sense.
[6320.50s - 6324.50s]:  Please check the pages we mentioned, the real numbers.
[6324.50s - 6326.50s]:  We did not react late, we reacted in time.
[6326.50s - 6335.50s]:  And today the culprits of the energy crisis are sentenced for corruption in the electricity industry.
[6335.50s - 6345.50s]:  You can clearly see in the case I find that the brother-in-law of the former president, as well as the former manager of Senel, are sentenced for corruption.
[6345.50s - 6347.50s]:  We came to correct what they did.
[6348.50s - 6349.50s]:  Thank you candidate Novoa.
[6349.50s - 6354.50s]:  In this way we are ending this third issue of Ecuador Debate 2025.
[6354.50s - 6361.50s]:  And we are entering the last part, where the candidates will have 25 seconds to give their final message to the citizens.
[6361.50s - 6364.50s]:  Candidate Henry Kronfle, run your 25 seconds.
[6364.50s - 6367.50s]:  Henry Kukalón, from now on.
[6367.50s - 6368.50s]:  Go ahead.
[6368.50s - 6374.50s]:  I want any child, regardless of their social condition, to be president.
[6374.50s - 6378.50s]:  To those who do not care, the country cannot govern.
[6378.50s - 6383.50s]:  My struggle for public service has been that no one stays behind.
[6383.50s - 6388.50s]:  Ecuadorian, vote for conviction, not for resignation.
[6388.50s - 6389.50s]:  Your vote matters.
[6389.50s - 6392.50s]:  I am Henry Kukalón and I am that child.
[6392.50s - 6397.50s]:  Candidate Jimmy Jerela Balaza, 25 seconds for your final message.
[6397.50s - 6403.50s]:  Like you, I want a country where our children do not have to leave, where they do not disappear.
[6403.50s - 6408.50s]:  A country with decent employment, with security and opportunities.
[6408.50s - 6413.50s]:  With your vote we will have that opportunity to end hatred and work for the future we dream of.
[6413.50s - 6417.50s]:  I am Jimmy Jerela and I will be your president.
[6417.50s - 6419.50s]:  Vote for everyone.
[6420.50s - 6423.50s]:  Candidate Francesco Tabaki, your 25 seconds. Start now.
[6424.50s - 6428.50s]:  Ecuadorians, when any president lies, we lose the Ecuadorians.
[6428.50s - 6431.50s]:  When a president makes a mistake, we hold the Ecuadorians.
[6431.50s - 6435.50s]:  When we do not have services, we lose everyone.
[6435.50s - 6437.50s]:  We break the circle.
[6437.50s - 6440.50s]:  Let's get this wonderful country together.
[6440.50s - 6444.50s]:  With a hard hand, a fair hand and a smart hand.
[6444.50s - 6447.50s]:  Tabaki, president, list 21.
[6448.50s - 6451.50s]:  Candidate Jorge Escala, your message in 25 seconds.
[6451.50s - 6452.50s]:  Start now.
[6452.50s - 6455.50s]:  I am going to 60% of the indecisors.
[6455.50s - 6457.50s]:  I understand them.
[6457.50s - 6458.50s]:  We are tired.
[6458.50s - 6462.50s]:  We have been ruled corrupt, bankers and millionaires.
[6462.50s - 6464.50s]:  They did everything wrong.
[6464.50s - 6467.50s]:  It is time to solve the problems of the family.
[6467.50s - 6471.50s]:  With health, education, work, housing.
[6471.50s - 6473.50s]:  Do not go and run.
[6473.50s - 6475.50s]:  Your time is up. It is the time of the people.
[6475.50s - 6477.50s]:  Vote for everyone.
[6478.50s - 6480.50s]:  Candidate Enrique Rofle-Cosaya.
[6480.50s - 6481.50s]:  Your turn now.
[6482.50s - 6484.50s]:  We cannot continue in a present without a direction.
[6484.50s - 6486.50s]:  Nor return to a corrupt past.
[6486.50s - 6490.50s]:  If you want to live well, neither Daniel nor Rafael.
[6490.50s - 6491.50s]:  One Ecuador.
[6491.50s - 6493.50s]:  I am Henry Cronfle.
[6493.50s - 6495.50s]:  My word is worth more than my signature.
[6495.50s - 6497.50s]:  I take care of the people more than my own.
[6497.50s - 6499.50s]:  And I take God in my heart.
[6499.50s - 6502.50s]:  With me, end fear and return hope.
[6502.50s - 6504.50s]:  Vote for Henry Cronfle.
[6504.50s - 6505.50s]:  Vote for your family.
[6505.50s - 6507.50s]:  We will have president again.
[6508.50s - 6510.50s]:  Candidate Luis Felipe Tilleria.
[6510.50s - 6512.50s]:  Your 25 seconds for the final message.
[6512.50s - 6516.50s]:  You want to deceive the people by saying that you only have two options.
[6516.50s - 6517.50s]:  Left.
[6517.50s - 6519.50s]:  Correismo versus anticorreismo.
[6519.50s - 6520.50s]:  But the people are not stupid.
[6520.50s - 6522.50s]:  All these politicians suck blood.
[6522.50s - 6524.50s]:  They have lived in the state.
[6524.50s - 6526.50s]:  I come to reset the system.
[6526.50s - 6528.50s]:  I am Luis Felipe Tilleria.
[6528.50s - 6531.50s]:  A migrant who fought, triumphed and returned.
[6531.50s - 6535.50s]:  To reset the system and turn Ecuador into a country of the first world.
[6535.50s - 6537.50s]:  Tilleria returned so you don't have to emigrate.
[6538.50s - 6539.50s]:  Candidate Juan Iván Cueva.
[6539.50s - 6542.50s]:  Your 25 seconds start now.
[6542.50s - 6545.50s]:  You have been told that there are only two options.
[6545.50s - 6547.50s]:  Ecuador is more.
[6547.50s - 6548.50s]:  All united.
[6548.50s - 6552.50s]:  Indians, black, white, gay, gay, heterosexual.
[6552.50s - 6553.50s]:  Yes, you can.
[6553.50s - 6556.50s]:  Today there is a third way.
[6556.50s - 6559.50s]:  On February 9, vote for your mother.
[6559.50s - 6560.50s]:  Vote for your father.
[6560.50s - 6561.50s]:  Vote for your children.
[6561.50s - 6563.50s]:  Vote for your family.
[6563.50s - 6566.50s]:  With the heart of the tricolor.
[6566.50s - 6568.50s]:  We will defend Ecuador.
[6568.50s - 6569.50s]:  God bless you.
[6569.50s - 6570.50s]:  Thank you candidate.
[6570.50s - 6574.50s]:  Finally candidate Daniel Novoacin has 25 seconds for his final message.
[6575.50s - 6579.50s]:  First, thank you very much Ecuadorians for joining me in this discussion.
[6579.50s - 6583.50s]:  In this debate that enriches democracy.
[6583.50s - 6586.50s]:  For national and provincial assemblymen, vote all seven.
[6586.50s - 6589.50s]:  For Andean parliamentarians, vote all seven.
[6589.50s - 6592.50s]:  For president and vice president, vote seven.
[6592.50s - 6594.50s]:  And for the old Ecuador, vote all seven.
[6595.50s - 6598.50s]:  Thank you candidates that have joined us in the first section.
[6598.50s - 6603.50s]:  With this intervention we are finishing the first section of the presidential debate 2025.
[6603.50s - 6605.50s]:  We extend ourselves a little bit.
[6605.50s - 6611.50s]:  We return with the second section of candidates of the obligatory presidential debate 2025.
[6611.50s - 6612.50s]:  Good evening.
[6612.50s - 6617.50s]:  With the aim of transparency the public raffle of the second interpellation.
[6617.50s - 6619.50s]:  We carry out this previous transmission.
[6619.50s - 6625.50s]:  At this moment Dr. Marcos Camaño, notary of the quarter of Pichincha, enters the set.
[6625.50s - 6630.50s]:  So that the candidates select randomly the envelopes that contain the colored cards.
[6630.50s - 6636.50s]:  That will be used for the second interpellation of the first thematic axis.
[6636.50s - 6638.50s]:  We continue, thank you for joining us.
[6638.50s - 6645.50s]:  The candidates are already in their atrile to start the development of the second section of Ecuador debate 2025.
[6645.50s - 6649.50s]:  The obligatory presidential debate organized by the National Electoral Council.
[6649.50s - 6653.50s]:  To promote an informed vote of citizenship in the general elections 2025.
[6653.50s - 6658.50s]:  And tonight we are meeting the 16 candidates for the presidency of the republic.
[6658.50s - 6661.50s]:  And especially their proposals around three thematic axes.
[6661.50s - 6663.50s]:  Which are security and prevention of crime.
[6663.50s - 6666.50s]:  Efficiency of the state and public services.
[6666.50s - 6669.50s]:  And economic growth and generation of employment.
[6669.50s - 6673.50s]:  It is important that citizenship knows that the national debate committee.
[6673.50s - 6677.50s]:  We were given two questions for each thematic axis.
[6677.50s - 6683.50s]:  That means that for this time frame we will use the second question.
[6683.50s - 6690.50s]:  The order of location, intervention, participation and first interpellation for each thematic axis.
[6690.50s - 6693.50s]:  As it happened with the first range of candidates.
[6693.50s - 6696.50s]:  The candidates were defined by a draw.
[6696.50s - 6698.50s]:  Whose act gave faith to a public notary.
[6698.50s - 6700.50s]:  It is important to highlight this.
[6700.50s - 6702.50s]:  And as part of the dynamics of this debate.
[6702.50s - 6705.50s]:  In compliance with the regulations and the manual.
[6705.50s - 6708.50s]:  During the development of this program we will make the draw of the second.
[6723.50s - 6725.50s]:  Thank you.
[6753.50s - 6755.50s]:  Thank you.
[6783.50s - 6785.50s]:  Thank you.
[6813.50s - 6815.50s]:  Thank you.
[6843.50s - 6849.50s]:  I think that nobody has wanted as much as who speaks to them to reach a presidential debate.
[6849.50s - 6852.50s]:  Maybe who was my biannual last year.
[6852.50s - 6853.50s]:  Surely.
[6853.50s - 6857.50s]:  If it were for the political class, I would not be here today.
[6857.50s - 6860.50s]:  And I represent that working class and the young people.
[6860.50s - 6864.50s]:  That we witnessed how our resources were stolen and divided.
[6864.50s - 6866.50s]:  Today I speak of development.
[6866.50s - 6870.50s]:  Because Luisa, I am anti-corrector for everything they did to the environment.
[6870.50s - 6872.50s]:  Thank you candidate.
[6872.50s - 6874.50s]:  Candidate Pedro Granja has 25 seconds to present himself.
[6874.50s - 6877.50s]:  I will fight child sexual abuse.
[6877.50s - 6879.50s]:  I will recover the ports.
[6879.50s - 6881.50s]:  I will punish the vaccinators.
[6881.50s - 6883.50s]:  We will give a final appointment.
[6883.50s - 6886.50s]:  To all public servants with provisional appointment.
[6886.50s - 6889.50s]:  I will watch for security guards.
[6889.50s - 6891.50s]:  Retired, peasants, fishermen.
[6891.50s - 6893.50s]:  For a different life.
[6893.50s - 6895.50s]:  Pedro Granja, president.
[6896.50s - 6899.50s]:  Candidate Iván Zacisela, your 25 seconds start now.
[6901.50s - 6903.50s]:  I am Iván Zacisela.
[6903.50s - 6905.50s]:  I come to debate.
[6905.50s - 6906.50s]:  I come to propose.
[6906.50s - 6908.50s]:  I am a university professor.
[6908.50s - 6911.50s]:  I have dedicated my whole life to the study of the state.
[6911.50s - 6913.50s]:  And the search for justice.

[6916.50s - 6917.50s]:  Welfare.

[6925.50s - 6928.50s]:  Ecuadorians and Ecuadorians.
[6928.50s - 6930.50s]:  You already know me.
[6930.50s - 6933.50s]:  We came here with the hope of a better future.
[6933.50s - 6937.50s]:  But we have not lost the ability to be indignant.
[6937.50s - 6941.50s]:  They have divided the country to protect their interests.
[6941.50s - 6944.50s]:  Today the people have their voice.
[6944.50s - 6947.50s]:  We are here to triumph in these elections.
[6947.50s - 6952.50s]:  Candidate Victor Arauz, your presentation of 25 seconds starts now.
[6952.50s - 6955.50s]:  I am General Victor Arauz.
[6955.50s - 6958.50s]:  36 years of experience in the national police.
[6958.50s - 6961.50s]:  The most decorated police in the history of Ecuador.
[6961.50s - 6964.50s]:  10 international decorations.
[6964.50s - 6969.50s]:  4 of the American government for my fight against terrorism and transnational crime.
[6969.50s - 6973.50s]:  I will put the criminals and the corrupt in jail.
[6973.50s - 6975.50s]:  Murderers and rapists in the cemetery.

[6976.50s - 6977.50s]:  I command them.
[6977.50s - 6978.50s]:  Thank you candidate.
[6978.50s - 6980.50s]:  Once this presentation is concluded.
[6980.50s - 6984.50s]:  We previously reported that as established the rules of debate.
[6984.50s - 6988.50s]:  Only in the cases that correspond to article 20.
[6988.50s - 6990.50s]:  That is shown at this time on your screens.
[6990.50s - 6992.50s]:  The moderators, Fabrizio and I.
[6992.50s - 6997.50s]:  We can interrupt the candidates for a period of up to 10 seconds.
[6997.50s - 7003.50s]:  As long as the answer of the candidate is removed from the development theme.
[7003.50s - 7007.50s]:  Or in compliance with the good practices established for this presidential debate.
[7007.50s - 7011.50s]:  The interruption will not be discounted from the time of the candidate's intervention.
[7011.50s - 7014.50s]:  We start the development of the first issue.
[7014.50s - 7016.50s]:  Security and prevention of crime.
[7016.50s - 7018.50s]:  According to the order previously drawn.
[7018.50s - 7021.50s]:  The first to intervene will be candidate Enrique Gómez.
[7021.50s - 7025.50s]:  Who will have 90 seconds to answer the general question.
[7025.50s - 7029.50s]:  That has been elaborated by the national committee of electoral debates.
[7029.50s - 7030.50s]:  Of course we start.
[7030.50s - 7032.50s]:  Candidates, here is the envelope.
[7032.50s - 7035.50s]:  In the amphora, the envelope is properly sealed.
[7035.50s - 7037.50s]:  And with the section of Mr. Notary.
[7038.50s - 7043.50s]:  We will proceed to the reading of the question corresponding to this first issue.
[7043.50s - 7049.50s]:  The Ecuadorians have seen that the public often stops criminals.
[7049.50s - 7052.50s]:  And the judges release them for corruption threats.
[7052.50s - 7055.50s]:  Specifically, candidate Enrique Gómez.
[7055.50s - 7058.50s]:  How do you propose to purify and protect the administration of justice.
[7058.50s - 7061.50s]:  Without affecting the independence of the state powers.
[7061.50s - 7064.50s]:  You have 90 seconds to answer and argue.
[7065.50s - 7068.50s]:  Ecuador needs security now.
[7068.50s - 7070.50s]:  Urgently.
[7070.50s - 7072.50s]:  And that is why for us.
[7072.50s - 7075.50s]:  A priority will be to guarantee.
[7075.50s - 7080.50s]:  How objective is the sanction that the judges give.
[7080.50s - 7083.50s]:  For this we will implement artificial intelligence.
[7083.50s - 7085.50s]:  The one that will allow us to see.
[7085.50s - 7088.50s]:  If it is blinded by fear.
[7088.50s - 7091.50s]:  Or if it is blinded by interests.
[7091.50s - 7093.50s]:  No more corrupt in our judicial system.
[7093.50s - 7096.50s]:  We have to guarantee adequate justice.
[7096.50s - 7098.50s]:  That allows us a prosperous country.
[7098.50s - 7101.50s]:  We will implement all the necessary mechanisms.
[7101.50s - 7104.50s]:  So that security allows us.
[7104.50s - 7105.50s]:  Here in Ecuador.
[7105.50s - 7107.50s]:  Walk free in this country.
[7107.50s - 7109.50s]:  So that more tourists come.
[7109.50s - 7111.50s]:  So that the investment is motivated.
[7111.50s - 7114.50s]:  So that Ecuador is a prosperous country.
[7114.50s - 7115.50s]:  As we want it.
[7115.50s - 7117.50s]:  And for that we will also implement.
[7117.50s - 7119.50s]:  A shield at the border level.
[7119.50s - 7122.50s]:  That allows us to control the income of weapons.
[7122.50s - 7123.50s]:  The fuel leak.
[7123.50s - 7125.50s]:  But also that drug trafficking.
[7125.50s - 7127.50s]:  That is affecting us so much.
[7127.50s - 7130.50s]:  And that is hurting our young people.
[7130.50s - 7131.50s]:  Our teenagers.
[7131.50s - 7133.50s]:  And society in general.
[7133.50s - 7137.50s]:  We cannot allow Ecuador to be a bad example.
[7137.50s - 7139.50s]:  Or a bad word at the international level.
[7139.50s - 7142.50s]:  We have to, from my government.
[7142.50s - 7144.50s]:  Be light for the world.
[7144.50s - 7147.50s]:  And put more exportation of Ecuador.
[7147.50s - 7148.50s]:  To the whole world.
[7148.50s - 7149.50s]:  Guaranteed better life.
[7149.50s - 7151.50s]:  Here in Ecuador.
[7151.50s - 7152.50s]:  Thank you candidate.
[7152.50s - 7154.50s]:  According to the previous raffle.

[7155.50s - 7157.50s]:  Will be done in 15 seconds.
[7157.50s - 7159.50s]:  Candidate Carlos Ravascal.
[7159.50s - 7160.50s]:  Go ahead candidate.
[7160.50s - 7161.50s]:  Candidate.
[7161.50s - 7162.50s]:  You say that on the border.
[7162.50s - 7165.50s]:  Will install military bases every 10 kilometers.
[7165.50s - 7168.50s]:  How would you finance 200 military bases.
[7168.50s - 7170.50s]:  Considering that the entire border.
[7170.50s - 7172.50s]:  Has 2115 kilometers.
[7172.50s - 7174.50s]:  Thank you candidate Ravascal.
[7174.50s - 7175.50s]:  Candidate Enrique Gomez.
[7175.50s - 7178.50s]:  30 seconds to respond from this moment.
[7178.50s - 7179.50s]:  Border north.
[7179.50s - 7181.50s]:  280 kilometers with Colombia.
[7181.50s - 7182.50s]:  Border with Peru.
[7182.50s - 7184.50s]:  320 kilometers.
[7184.50s - 7185.50s]:  It is not every 10 kilometers.
[7185.50s - 7187.50s]:  It is every 30 kilometers.
[7187.50s - 7190.50s]:  And that is why we are going to launch an immediate project.
[7190.50s - 7193.50s]:  We have decided to invest 1,200 million.
[7193.50s - 7195.50s]:  That allow us to cover.
[7195.50s - 7196.50s]:  With technology.
[7196.50s - 7197.50s]:  With bases.
[7197.50s - 7198.50s]:  With personnel.
[7198.50s - 7199.50s]:  The entire territory.
[7199.50s - 7201.50s]:  To protect these income.
[7201.50s - 7202.50s]:  But also themselves.
[7202.50s - 7204.50s]:  The ports and airports.
[7204.50s - 7206.50s]:  That are not an exit source.
[7206.50s - 7208.50s]:  Of what we do not want.
[7208.50s - 7209.50s]:  As you could see.
[7209.50s - 7211.50s]:  Prior to the beginning of this second.
[7211.50s - 7213.50s]:  The same dynamic of the first.
[7213.50s - 7216.50s]:  The notary gave the envelopes to the candidates.

[7218.50s - 7219.50s]:  His envelope and placed it.
[7219.50s - 7221.50s]:  In the amphora located in his atriles.
[7221.50s - 7222.50s]:  These envelopes.
[7222.50s - 7224.50s]:  Will be opened for the development of the second.
[7224.50s - 7227.50s]:  Interpretation of the first thematic axis.

[7240.50s - 7241.50s]:  We raise them.
[7241.50s - 7242.50s]:  So that you can see.
[7242.50s - 7243.50s]:  At this time.
[7243.50s - 7244.50s]:  On your screens.
[7244.50s - 7245.50s]:  There you have them.
[7245.50s - 7246.50s]:  Then.
[7246.50s - 7248.50s]:  We will continue with the second interpellation.

[7259.50s - 7261.50s]:  You have 15 seconds to interpell the candidate.
[7261.50s - 7263.50s]:  Enrique Gomez runs the time now.
[7263.50s - 7264.50s]:  In terms of security.
[7264.50s - 7266.50s]:  We have to understand that there is money.
[7266.50s - 7267.50s]:  Not only from bribery.
[7267.50s - 7269.50s]:  But also from illegal mining.
[7269.50s - 7271.50s]:  And drug trafficking that permeates.
[7271.50s - 7272.50s]:  Public or private institutions.
[7272.50s - 7273.50s]:  It is part of the security.
[7273.50s - 7276.50s]:  How would we control that the case of Brecht is not repeated?
[7276.50s - 7277.50s]:  Thank you candidate.
[7277.50s - 7278.50s]:  Candidate Enrique Gomez.
[7278.50s - 7280.50s]:  30 seconds for your answer.
[7280.50s - 7281.50s]:  Transparency.
[7281.50s - 7282.50s]:  Above all.
[7282.50s - 7283.50s]:  And despite everything.
[7283.50s - 7286.50s]:  Despite the fear that we live in Ecuador today.
[7286.50s - 7288.50s]:  That is why artificial intelligence.
[7288.50s - 7291.50s]:  Will allow us to do a permanent monitoring.
[7291.50s - 7292.50s]:  Of every decision.
[7292.50s - 7294.50s]:  Of every judgment.
[7294.50s - 7295.50s]:  Of every process.
[7295.50s - 7297.50s]:  And in the interrelation of information.
[7297.50s - 7299.50s]:  Of each of the government agencies.
[7299.50s - 7303.50s]:  We will be able to see clearly what is happening.
[7303.50s - 7305.50s]:  And make decisions.
[7305.50s - 7308.50s]:  To depute and restructure the government.
[7309.50s - 7312.50s]:  It is the turn now of the candidate Luisa Gonzalez.
[7312.50s - 7315.50s]:  Who will have 90 seconds to answer the following question.
[7315.50s - 7316.50s]:  That says so.
[7316.50s - 7317.50s]:  Ecuadorians.
[7317.50s - 7319.50s]:  We have seen that the public force.
[7319.50s - 7320.50s]:  Many times.
[7320.50s - 7321.50s]:  Detaines criminals.
[7321.50s - 7323.50s]:  And the judges release them.
[7323.50s - 7325.50s]:  For corruption or threats.
[7325.50s - 7326.50s]:  Specifically candidate.
[7326.50s - 7330.50s]:  How do you propose to depute and protect the administration of justice.
[7330.50s - 7333.50s]:  Without affecting the independence of powers of the state.
[7333.50s - 7335.50s]:  It has 90 seconds from now.
[7335.50s - 7337.50s]:  I ask the Ecuadorians.
[7337.50s - 7339.50s]:  Who of you feels safe.
[7339.50s - 7341.50s]:  When he is a victim of a crime.
[7341.50s - 7343.50s]:  And he goes before the function of justice.
[7343.50s - 7345.50s]:  Who of you feels safe.
[7345.50s - 7347.50s]:  That he will not be crushed.
[7347.50s - 7350.50s]:  He will be the one who has the most money.
[7350.50s - 7351.50s]:  Or stronger.
[7351.50s - 7353.50s]:  This has to change.
[7353.50s - 7354.50s]:  Three concrete actions.
[7354.50s - 7355.50s]:  First.
[7355.50s - 7357.50s]:  Strong institutions.
[7357.50s - 7358.50s]:  Second.
[7358.50s - 7360.50s]:  Coordination between the functions of the state.
[7360.50s - 7361.50s]:  And third.
[7361.50s - 7362.50s]:  Technology.
[7362.50s - 7363.50s]:  The first.
[7363.50s - 7366.50s]:  Depuration of the bad elements.
[7366.50s - 7368.50s]:  Through the UAFE.

[7435.50s - 7439.50s]:  office of the law enforcement to Italy, the painful case
[7439.50s - 7443.50s]:  of narcovalija, which is going to prevent drug trafficking
[7443.50s - 7445.50s]:  from the state.

[7449.50s - 7451.50s]:  question now.
[7451.50s - 7454.50s]:  Candidate Granja, you who always talk about the National
[7454.50s - 7458.50s]:  Anti-Mafia Italian address, it seems that you do not know that
[7458.50s - 7462.50s]:  that same address was intended for 10 years to the responsible
[7462.50s - 7464.50s]:  and said that my government was innocent.
[7464.50s - 7466.50s]:  Thank you very much.

[7469.50s - 7472.50s]:  that you have, candidate Isa will perform the second
[7472.50s - 7476.50s]:  interpellation in 15 seconds from now on.
[7476.50s - 7479.50s]:  One of the serious problems facing Ecuador is the
[7479.50s - 7481.50s]:  infiltration of narco in politics.
[7481.50s - 7483.50s]:  What will you do?
[7483.50s - 7486.50s]:  Candidate Luisa González, answer the second interpellation.
[7486.50s - 7488.50s]:  30 seconds, run time.

[7491.50s - 7495.50s]:  the WAFE to do the analysis through the washing of assets
[7495.50s - 7500.50s]:  and see who has used funds that are not legal and thus
[7500.50s - 7503.50s]:  also control the money that enters the bank.
[7503.50s - 7507.50s]:  70% of the resources that are mobilized through illegal
[7507.50s - 7512.50s]:  trade in large quantities goes to the bank.
[7513.50s - 7515.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Luisa González.
[7515.50s - 7517.50s]:  Now you will have to answer the same question to candidate
[7517.50s - 7518.50s]:  Carlos Ravascal.
[7518.50s - 7522.50s]:  The Ecuadorians have seen that the public force many times
[7522.50s - 7526.50s]:  detains criminals and judges release them for corruption
[7526.50s - 7527.50s]:  or threats.
[7527.50s - 7531.50s]:  Candidate, specifically, how do you propose to purge and
[7531.50s - 7534.50s]:  protect the administration of justice without affecting
[7534.50s - 7536.50s]:  the independence of powers of the state?
[7536.50s - 7540.50s]:  You have 90 seconds to answer from this moment.
[7540.50s - 7544.50s]:  I see and observe that the issue of security is basically
[7544.50s - 7549.50s]:  focusing on the forces of security and judicial function.
[7549.50s - 7554.50s]:  But we cannot separate the security of the economy,
[7554.50s - 7558.50s]:  of production, of work, of judicial function and
[7558.50s - 7560.50s]:  of territorial equity.
[7560.50s - 7563.50s]:  It seems that we believe that to fight organized crime
[7563.50s - 7566.50s]:  we only have to militarize the country.
[7566.50s - 7570.50s]:  And it is good that the armed forces are complementary to
[7570.50s - 7572.50s]:  the actions of the police.
[7572.50s - 7576.50s]:  But we must have a system of intelligence that is quite
[7576.50s - 7577.50s]:  efficient.
[7577.50s - 7581.50s]:  But it turns out that this system of intelligence is
[7581.50s - 7583.50s]:  controlled by organized crime.
[7583.50s - 7588.50s]:  As a consequence of that, we have to act strategically.
[7588.50s - 7590.50s]:  And what should we do then?
[7590.50s - 7593.50s]:  We have to create a system of counterintelligence to be able
[7593.50s - 7598.50s]:  to depute those state agents who are infiltrated.
[7598.50s - 7602.50s]:  But beyond that, we have to strengthen the police.
[7602.50s - 7606.50s]:  It cannot continue to be the poor sister of the security forces.
[7606.50s - 7610.50s]:  A specialized civil police in the fight against corruption and
[7610.50s - 7611.50s]:  organized crime.
[7611.50s - 7617.50s]:  And a police uniformed territory that is making presence in
[7617.50s - 7618.50s]:  the territories.
[7618.50s - 7622.50s]:  And a great reform to judicial function, which I will refer to
[7622.50s - 7623.50s]:  later.
[7623.50s - 7625.50s]:  Thank you, candidate.
[7625.50s - 7628.50s]:  The first question according to the previous draw.
[7628.50s - 7632.50s]:  The question to your answer will be answered in 15 seconds by
[7632.50s - 7633.50s]:  candidate Victor Arauz.
[7633.50s - 7634.50s]:  The time is now.
[7634.50s - 7640.50s]:  It is easy to talk about rehabilitation when the dead
[7640.50s - 7644.50s]:  is not his dead or when the kidnapped is not his family.
[7644.50s - 7647.50s]:  Tell Ecuador how many dead and kidnapped more will have to
[7647.50s - 7649.50s]:  wait until their plan is fulfilled.
[7649.50s - 7651.50s]:  Candidate Carlos Ravascal has 30 seconds to answer.
[7651.50s - 7659.50s]:  Mr. Candidate, I respect it, but I do not agree with the way
[7659.50s - 7660.50s]:  of his proposal.
[7660.50s - 7664.50s]:  I have to respect the lives of the victims.
[7664.50s - 7666.50s]:  And that for me is fundamental.
[7666.50s - 7668.50s]:  The human rights of the victims.
[7668.50s - 7674.50s]:  Those who transfer the law have to be sentenced and go to jail
[7674.50s - 7677.50s]:  through an independent and autonomous justice.
[7677.50s - 7682.50s]:  But we also have to work on a reclassification of crimes and
[7682.50s - 7684.50s]:  categorization of the privates of freedom.
[7684.50s - 7685.50s]:  Thank you, candidate.
[7685.50s - 7686.50s]:  Your time is up.
[7686.50s - 7690.50s]:  According to the coincidence of colors, candidate Pedro Granja
[7690.50s - 7692.50s]:  will intervene in 15 seconds.
[7692.50s - 7693.50s]:  Candidate Carlos Ravascal.
[7693.50s - 7695.50s]:  Go ahead, candidate Granja, 15 seconds.
[7695.50s - 7700.50s]:  Carlos, I beg you to distinguish between molecular crime and organized
[7700.50s - 7702.50s]:  crime so that the country knows your proposal.
[7702.50s - 7705.50s]:  Candidate Carlos Ravascal, in 30 seconds your answer.
[7705.50s - 7711.50s]:  Mr. Candidate, one of the problems that Ecuadorian politics has is
[7711.50s - 7715.50s]:  that we believe that we know more than the other.
[7715.50s - 7719.50s]:  And here what we have to implement is an integral policy.
[7719.50s - 7723.50s]:  Ecuador does not have a criminal policy.
[7723.50s - 7728.50s]:  We have to recover the peace and tranquility of the Ecuadorian families.
[7728.50s - 7732.50s]:  We have to recover and rescue our children who are being
[7732.50s - 7734.50s]:  controlled by organized crime.
[7734.50s - 7737.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Carlos Ravascal.
[7737.50s - 7740.50s]:  It is the turn of candidate Andrea González who will answer the
[7740.50s - 7742.50s]:  following question in 90 seconds.
[7742.50s - 7743.50s]:  The question says so.
[7743.50s - 7744.50s]:  I read it again.
[7744.50s - 7748.50s]:  The Ecuadorians have seen that the public force often stops
[7748.50s - 7753.50s]:  criminals and judges release them for corruption or threats.
[7753.50s - 7757.50s]:  Specifically, candidate, how do you propose to purge and protect the
[7757.50s - 7761.50s]:  administration of justice without affecting the independence of
[7761.50s - 7762.50s]:  powers of the state?
[7762.50s - 7765.50s]:  Your time starts now, 90 seconds.
[7765.50s - 7769.50s]:  We have a very clear panorama and that is that the 21st century socialism
[7769.50s - 7772.50s]:  agreed with the FARC the use of our territorial sea to extract all
[7772.50s - 7773.50s]:  the cocaine from the country.
[7773.50s - 7777.50s]:  The result of this is a constitution with a chavist and
[7777.50s - 7781.50s]:  guarantor soul that has our judges against the wall and the police
[7781.50s - 7785.50s]:  being cannon fodder where they take the criminals to jail
[7785.50s - 7786.50s]:  so that they can train.
[7786.50s - 7790.50s]:  We have turned prisons into training centers and justice is
[7790.50s - 7792.50s]:  totally taken by narco politics.
[7792.50s - 7797.50s]:  If we understand that the security crisis and the economic crisis are
[7797.50s - 7801.50s]:  the children of the political crisis that took over our country and
[7801.50s - 7805.50s]:  gave our resources for a personal project instead of getting us out of
[7805.50s - 7808.50s]:  under development, we understand that with this guarantor constitution
[7808.50s - 7811.50s]:  we will never get out of the grip of drug trafficking.
[7811.50s - 7815.50s]:  We propose to cut the funding of these organized criminal groups
[7815.50s - 7818.50s]:  what they are looking for is the sea out.
[7818.50s - 7821.50s]:  In Ecuador it is the other way around.
[7821.50s - 7824.50s]:  What does not come out by sea would not enter by the northern border and
[7824.50s - 7825.50s]:  by the southern border.
[7825.50s - 7828.50s]:  We have exhausted our military in the northern and southern borders
[7828.50s - 7830.50s]:  when what they are looking for are the ports.
[7830.50s - 7834.50s]:  80% of the drug in this country comes out through the private ports of
[7834.50s - 7837.50s]:  my city of Guayaquil or through other coastal ports.
[7837.50s - 7840.50s]:  That is why our candidate Vice President is a counter-administrator
[7840.50s - 7842.50s]:  who can tell us in detail how our sovereignty was
[7842.50s - 7845.50s]:  and of course our peace and tranquility was agreed upon.
[7845.50s - 7848.50s]:  According to the previous draw, the first interpellation to your answer
[7848.50s - 7851.50s]:  will be made in 15 seconds by candidate Iván Zacisela.
[7851.50s - 7852.50s]:  Time starts.
[7852.50s - 7857.50s]:  When I was president of the national court I defended judicial independence.
[7857.50s - 7861.50s]:  Among other things, the vowels of the Judiciary Council were
[7861.50s - 7863.50s]:  suspended and penalized.
[7863.50s - 7866.50s]:  What would you do with the Judiciary Council?
[7866.50s - 7869.50s]:  I would defend the judicial independence.
[7869.50s - 7872.50s]:  What would you do with the Judiciary Council?
[7872.50s - 7876.50s]:  Candidate Andrea Gonzalez has 30 seconds to answer the first interpellation.
[7876.50s - 7877.50s]:  Now.
[7877.50s - 7881.50s]:  Well, I have never let Will Van Teran be president of the Judiciary Council.
[7881.50s - 7882.50s]:  Let's start there.
[7882.50s - 7885.50s]:  I think that after the purges, metastasis, plagues, encounters,
[7885.50s - 7888.50s]:  we realize that the judges on the right and left are the ones who share
[7888.50s - 7890.50s]:  with the drug trafficker on duty.
[7890.50s - 7893.50s]:  And today they share the jail, partner and partner.
[7893.50s - 7897.50s]:  Unfortunately, in this five-legged cat with a constitution that is not
[7897.50s - 7900.50s]:  understood by the best constitutionalist, where there are five powers,
[7900.50s - 7902.50s]:  it is crazy to seek independence.
[7902.50s - 7905.50s]:  Unfortunately, I do believe that Ecuador is a narco-state.
[7905.50s - 7909.50s]:  Candidate Andrea Gonzalez, the color of the card you have is the same as
[7909.50s - 7912.50s]:  that of candidate Enrique Gómez, gray color.
[7912.50s - 7913.50s]:  They match.
[7913.50s - 7916.50s]:  Candidate Gómez will make the interpellation in 15 seconds.
[7916.50s - 7918.50s]:  From now on.
[7918.50s - 7921.50s]:  Andrea, what efforts are you going to make?
[7921.50s - 7925.50s]:  How long will it take you and how hard will it be to guarantee
[7925.50s - 7927.50s]:  security to each Ecuadorian?
[7927.50s - 7929.50s]:  What do we want the most?
[7929.50s - 7933.50s]:  Candidate Andrea Gonzalez, please answer in 30 seconds.
[7933.50s - 7936.50s]:  And thank you for the question, especially with the efforts.
[7936.50s - 7939.50s]:  Having been a teacher for seven years in one of the most dangerous
[7939.50s - 7942.50s]:  cities in the world, such as Juequil, I understand that the repair of
[7942.50s - 7945.50s]:  social fabric is a fundamental weapon.
[7945.50s - 7949.50s]:  Our children have changed their future for 16 years.
[7949.50s - 7952.50s]:  And let me tell you that our teenagers have not left the weapons
[7952.50s - 7954.50s]:  for the sake of watching a TikTok.
[7954.50s - 7957.50s]:  Our teenagers were removed, the passports paid, the specialization
[7957.50s - 7961.50s]:  of the school, all effort to be part of a country, to be
[7961.50s - 7965.50s]:  sheep of a political project that wanted to idiot them.
[7965.50s - 7966.50s]:  Thank you, candidate.
[7966.50s - 7967.50s]:  Your time is up.
[7967.50s - 7970.50s]:  Now it is up to you to answer the question of this axis.
[7970.50s - 7973.50s]:  Candidate Pedro Granja, we recapitulate.
[7973.50s - 7976.50s]:  The Ecuadorians have seen that the public force often detains
[7976.50s - 7980.50s]:  criminals and judges release them for corruption or threats.
[7980.50s - 7983.50s]:  Specifically, candidate Granja, how do you propose to depurate and
[7983.50s - 7986.50s]:  protect the administration of justice without affecting the
[7986.50s - 7988.50s]:  independence of the powers of the state?
[7988.50s - 7990.50s]:  Your 90 seconds start now.
[7990.50s - 7993.50s]:  Of course, the DIN does not sentence anyone.
[7993.50s - 7996.50s]:  A quintal of cocaine came out from the Ecuadorian
[7996.50s - 7999.50s]:  office in the government of candidate Gonzalez.
[7999.50s - 8001.50s]:  What am I going to do with the judicial power?
[8001.50s - 8002.50s]:  Nothing.
[8002.50s - 8003.50s]:  If I am a democrat, I cannot.
[8003.50s - 8006.50s]:  Because if I put my hand on justice, I become a dictator.
[8006.50s - 8009.50s]:  The only way to depurate it is with a constitutional assembly.
[8009.50s - 8011.50s]:  But we will talk about that.
[8011.50s - 8015.50s]:  I think the country needs to start speaking in Spanish.
[8015.50s - 8020.50s]:  The murder of four poor children in Tauras is not criminal policy.
[8020.50s - 8022.50s]:  It is a crime of the state.
[8022.50s - 8024.50s]:  My plan of criminal policy is divided.
[8024.50s - 8027.50s]:  Prevention policies, dissuasion policies,
[8027.50s - 8031.50s]:  repression policies, and rehabilitation policies.
[8031.50s - 8035.50s]:  The first ones attack the root of the problem, not the disease.
[8035.50s - 8038.14s]:  We look at the risk factors, school
[8038.14s - 8041.50s]:  school-school exception, problematic drug use.
[8041.50s - 8045.50s]:  The second ones have to do with situational prevention,
[8045.50s - 8049.50s]:  changing the environment to make it more difficult to work as a criminal.
[8049.50s - 8052.50s]:  The third one, the DIN, the National Anti-Mafia Direction,
[8052.50s - 8055.50s]:  which will hit with intelligence, because this is not a gun fight,
[8055.50s - 8058.50s]:  with intelligence, fundamentally, in the mobilization of
[8058.50s - 8061.50s]:  goods and services from one point to another, but in the
[8061.50s - 8062.50s]:  washing of assets.
[8062.50s - 8064.50s]:  And finally, the plan reintegrates.
[8064.50s - 8067.50s]:  All prisoners will work in penitentiary farms.
[8067.50s - 8070.50s]:  Each one will have to pay their food, and when they are released,
[8070.50s - 8075.50s]:  they will receive part of their salary to be able to start a business.
[8075.50s - 8078.50s]:  This is a true plan of criminal policy, which obviously
[8078.50s - 8080.50s]:  has to be studied.
[8080.50s - 8081.50s]:  Thank you, candidate.
[8081.50s - 8084.50s]:  Candidate Andrea Gonzalez will give the first answer.
[8084.50s - 8087.50s]:  According to the previous draw, Candidate Gonzalez has 15 seconds.
[8087.50s - 8089.50s]:  Your time is running now.
[8089.50s - 8092.50s]:  Pedro, this is a 100% real question.
[8092.50s - 8095.50s]:  In the previous interview, you would return the safe to Jorge
[8095.50s - 8096.50s]:  Glass.
[8096.50s - 8098.50s]:  Is that true or do you understand?
[8098.50s - 8099.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Gonzalez.
[8099.50s - 8101.50s]:  Candidate Granja has 30 seconds.
[8101.50s - 8103.50s]:  There is confusion in terms of this.
[8103.50s - 8106.50s]:  Induct would be an intervention of the president of the
[8106.50s - 8108.50s]:  republic to free this criminal.
[8108.50s - 8112.50s]:  I have said that in the case that the judicial power releases him and
[8112.50s - 8115.50s]:  we resume diplomatic relations with Mexico, I have to grant the
[8115.50s - 8118.50s]:  safe, because international law forces me to do so.
[8118.50s - 8121.50s]:  Unfortunately, I am a man of law.
[8121.50s - 8122.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Granja.
[8122.50s - 8125.50s]:  The second question, due to the coincidence of colors,
[8125.50s - 8127.50s]:  will be given by candidate Carlos Ravascal.
[8127.50s - 8129.50s]:  He has 15 seconds.
[8129.50s - 8132.50s]:  Mr. candidate, what would be the policy of drugs, considering
[8132.50s - 8135.50s]:  that there are children who have fallen into addiction and there are
[8135.50s - 8138.50s]:  families who have become co-dependent?
[8138.50s - 8139.50s]:  Thank you, candidate.
[8139.50s - 8142.50s]:  Candidate Granja has 30 seconds from this moment.
[8142.50s - 8143.50s]:  Yes, wonderful question.
[8143.50s - 8147.50s]:  The problematic consumption of drugs has to do fundamentally with
[8147.50s - 8148.50s]:  a structural problem.
[8148.50s - 8152.50s]:  That is, the lack of equity in the redistribution of national
[8152.50s - 8153.50s]:  income.
[8153.50s - 8156.50s]:  What I believe is that in order to face the phenomenon of drug
[8156.50s - 8159.50s]:  trafficking, we have to remove the social base from the gangs.
[8159.50s - 8162.50s]:  This is done by taking care of risk factors.
[8162.50s - 8165.50s]:  Unfortunately, with 15 seconds, 30 seconds, I cannot express
[8165.50s - 8169.50s]:  some important ideas, but fundamentally with prevention
[8169.50s - 8170.50s]:  policies.
[8170.50s - 8172.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Granja.
[8172.50s - 8175.50s]:  Candidate Iván Sáquicela, it is time for your intervention.
[8175.50s - 8176.50s]:  I am going to read the question.
[8176.50s - 8180.50s]:  The Ecuadorians have seen that the public often detains
[8180.50s - 8185.50s]:  criminals and judges release them for corruption or threats.
[8185.50s - 8189.50s]:  Specifically, how do you propose to purge and protect the
[8189.50s - 8192.50s]:  administration of justice without affecting the independence
[8192.50s - 8193.50s]:  of powers of the state?
[8193.50s - 8195.50s]:  Your time runs, 90 seconds.
[8195.50s - 8198.50s]:  What you say is serious and when I was president of the court,
[8198.50s - 8199.50s]:  I denounced it.
[8199.50s - 8203.50s]:  For example, when Jorge Glas was given a habeas corpus in
[8203.50s - 8204.50s]:  the state of Banclararto.
[8204.50s - 8207.50s]:  For example, when the same citizen was given back the
[8207.50s - 8208.50s]:  political rights.
[8208.50s - 8209.50s]:  What to do?
[8209.50s - 8210.50s]:  To transform.
[8210.50s - 8217.50s]:  I propose a plan called OSICO, which means intervention of
[8217.50s - 8222.50s]:  the United Nations to be able to make an objective and
[8222.50s - 8224.50s]:  transnational evaluation.
[8224.50s - 8229.50s]:  We are going to give civil death to the corrupt, that is, we are
[8229.50s - 8233.50s]:  going to give them with the OSICO in the framework of the
[8233.50s - 8235.50s]:  Ecuadorian legal framework.
[8235.50s - 8237.50s]:  What else are we going to do?
[8237.50s - 8241.50s]:  It is fundamental, my priority, those who live in poverty and
[8241.50s - 8242.50s]:  inequality.
[8242.50s - 8244.50s]:  It is fundamental to criminal policy.
[8244.50s - 8249.50s]:  This means that we are going to invest in people to precisely
[8249.50s - 8253.50s]:  go with the primary means in criminal matters.
[8253.50s - 8258.50s]:  On the other hand, we are going to create the defense of the
[8258.50s - 8262.50s]:  country, which is the victim, because today the rules are
[8262.50s - 8264.50s]:  privileging criminals.
[8264.50s - 8269.50s]:  The prison problem, we are going to create the FIAAG, which
[8269.50s - 8273.50s]:  means force of intelligence and prison administration.
[8273.50s - 8277.50s]:  This means a radical change of concept.
[8277.50s - 8281.50s]:  It is fundamental to change rules, evaluate judges and
[8281.50s - 8283.50s]:  corrupt officials to jail.
[8283.50s - 8286.50s]:  In the previous draw, it was defined that the first
[8286.50s - 8288.50s]:  interpellation will be carried out in 15 seconds.
[8288.50s - 8291.50s]:  Candidate Enrique Gomez, run time.
[8291.50s - 8296.50s]:  Candidate, we agree to implement artificial intelligence to
[8296.50s - 8302.50s]:  guarantee correct justice and also to guarantee through judges
[8302.50s - 8304.50s]:  without faces.
[8304.50s - 8307.50s]:  Candidate Iván Zacisela has 30 seconds to answer the first
[8307.50s - 8308.50s]:  interpellation.
[8308.50s - 8311.50s]:  Not only that, it is a profound reform.
[8311.50s - 8315.50s]:  I believe in effect in the use of artificial intelligence
[8315.50s - 8318.50s]:  but it is fundamental to go beyond.
[8318.50s - 8321.50s]:  There are two lines, the one, an energetic arm against the
[8321.50s - 8325.50s]:  lava of assets, corruption, organized crime and on the other
[8325.50s - 8329.50s]:  hand, from a criminal point of view, we are going with criminal
[8329.50s - 8333.50s]:  policy, with social policy, with investment in the poor
[8333.50s - 8335.50s]:  sectors, in the bars, in the bars.
[8335.50s - 8339.50s]:  It is not just a police concept, that is wrong, science and
[8339.50s - 8341.50s]:  criminology say.
[8341.50s - 8344.50s]:  Candidate Iván Zacisela, according to the color of the card
[8344.50s - 8348.50s]:  you have, the candidate Víctor Arauz will perform the second
[8348.50s - 8350.50s]:  interpellation in 15 seconds.
[8350.50s - 8354.50s]:  How could you, candidate Zacisela, change a country if
[8354.50s - 8357.50s]:  a single institution, the court of justice that you presided over,
[8357.50s - 8361.50s]:  could not change it in years and that institution is still today
[8361.50s - 8364.50s]:  the highest representation of the corruption and putrefaction of
[8364.50s - 8365.50s]:  the state?
[8365.50s - 8368.50s]:  Candidate Iván Zacisela, answer in 30 seconds, please.
[8368.50s - 8371.50s]:  Among other things, I denounced with my signature and headline the
[8371.50s - 8372.50s]:  general prosecutor.
[8372.50s - 8376.50s]:  We are going to depurate the drug dealers and all public officials
[8376.50s - 8378.50s]:  corrupt with civil death.
[8378.50s - 8382.50s]:  When I was president of the court, it was not my contributions,
[8382.50s - 8385.50s]:  that is the advice of the judiciary, but here, for example,
[8385.50s - 8389.50s]:  here is how I took away the trust of Wilma Enteran and also,
[8389.50s - 8393.50s]:  I always protested against the investment of hands in justice
[8393.50s - 8397.50s]:  and when I was a judge, the sentences speak for me, Contenea,
[8397.50s - 8399.50s]:  Correa and Aguilas, please.
[8399.50s - 8402.50s]:  Candidate Iván Zacisela, now it is the turn of candidate Leonida
[8402.50s - 8403.50s]:  Ciza.
[8403.50s - 8407.50s]:  The question of this block, the Ecuadorians have seen that the
[8407.50s - 8411.50s]:  public often stops criminals and judges release them for
[8411.50s - 8412.50s]:  corruption or threats.
[8412.50s - 8416.50s]:  Specifically, candidate Ciza, how do you propose to depurate and
[8416.50s - 8418.50s]:  protect the administration of justice without affecting the
[8418.50s - 8420.50s]:  independence of the powers of the state?
[8420.50s - 8423.50s]:  You have 90 seconds to answer from this moment.
[8423.50s - 8428.50s]:  Ecuadorians, let's be honest, it is not a problem only of judges and
[8428.50s - 8432.50s]:  prosecutors, it is a structural problem, that is why in our
[8432.50s - 8436.50s]:  government we will not only persecute the soldiers of the mafia,
[8436.50s - 8437.50s]:  we will go after their bosses.
[8437.50s - 8441.50s]:  That is why we are going to do, first, we are going to suffocate
[8441.50s - 8445.50s]:  the criminal economy, which is not only of the criminals,
[8445.50s - 8449.50s]:  but also of economic groups that benefit.
[8449.50s - 8454.50s]:  Second, fight against crime, against the criminals, who do
[8454.50s - 8457.50s]:  hell with the lives of our Ecuadorians, hell will be theirs,
[8457.50s - 8460.50s]:  in the first 90 days of my government.
[8460.50s - 8464.50s]:  Third, we will close the borders, which is not only of drugs,
[8464.50s - 8467.50s]:  but also of weapons, that is why we are going to improve the
[8467.50s - 8471.50s]:  intelligence system, but we are also going to depurate the
[8471.50s - 8474.50s]:  bad guys from the good elements of the armed forces.
[8474.50s - 8478.50s]:  Four, coordination and international cooperation, we will
[8478.50s - 8482.50s]:  meet with the governments of the countries that are involved in
[8482.50s - 8487.50s]:  consumption, production and drug transit to solve this problem together.
[8487.50s - 8492.50s]:  Five, recover our neighborhoods, towns, cities, from the mafias,
[8492.50s - 8494.50s]:  no more.
[8494.50s - 8498.50s]:  Recruit our young people and children from the mafias, we will
[8498.50s - 8504.50s]:  provide worthy services, food, health, work, education, recreation,
[8504.50s - 8509.50s]:  zero impunity in our government to the femicides, violence against
[8509.50s - 8511.50s]:  our children, never again.
[8511.50s - 8512.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Isa.
[8512.50s - 8515.50s]:  In the previous draw, it was established that the first
[8515.50s - 8518.50s]:  interpellation to your answer will be made in 15 seconds by
[8518.50s - 8520.50s]:  candidate Luisa Gonzalez.
[8520.50s - 8521.50s]:  Go ahead, please.
[8521.50s - 8524.50s]:  Ecuador is the most violent country in the region.
[8524.50s - 8528.50s]:  This government offered floating prisons and in Antarctica.
[8528.50s - 8531.50s]:  What would be its prison policy?
[8531.50s - 8534.50s]:  Candidate Isa has 30 seconds to respond.
[8534.50s - 8538.50s]:  As long as the lie has become a policy code, we will continue
[8538.50s - 8543.50s]:  listening to these governments that intend to solve the problem.
[8543.50s - 8548.50s]:  In our planning, first, you have to take prisons from the 36
[8548.50s - 8550.50s]:  prisons that the country has.
[8550.50s - 8553.50s]:  You do not even have the capacity to control the prisons, which are
[8553.50s - 8557.50s]:  now centers of operations and now intend to put prisons in the
[8557.50s - 8559.50s]:  territories of indigenous peoples.
[8559.50s - 8562.50s]:  If we want to put, we will put in the banana farms where the
[8562.50s - 8564.50s]:  drug trafficking is.
[8564.50s - 8565.50s]:  Thank you, candidate.
[8565.50s - 8569.50s]:  The coincidence in the cards forces the interpellation to be repeated.
[8569.50s - 8572.50s]:  According to the second interpellation, Luisa Gonzalez has 15 seconds
[8572.50s - 8574.50s]:  to interpell candidate Isa.
[8574.50s - 8581.50s]:  Ecuador closes 2024 with 6,910 murders.
[8581.50s - 8583.50s]:  We are the most violent.
[8583.50s - 8587.50s]:  Do you agree that the Phoenix Plan and the increase in the IBA have been
[8587.50s - 8589.50s]:  a failure of this government?
[8589.50s - 8591.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Luinidad Siza.
[8591.50s - 8592.50s]:  30 seconds to respond.
[8592.50s - 8596.50s]:  To begin with, there is no Phoenix Plan and the money they took from our
[8596.50s - 8602.50s]:  pockets of 3% more did not serve to secure, they served to kneel to the
[8602.50s - 8604.50s]:  International Monetary Fund.
[8604.50s - 8608.50s]:  Consequently, there is no integral plan to really face the mafias, the
[8608.50s - 8609.50s]:  crime.
[8609.50s - 8615.50s]:  Rather, it is the economic groups linked to this crime that are benefiting
[8615.50s - 8616.50s]:  no more.
[8616.50s - 8618.50s]:  They can deceive the people.
[8618.50s - 8620.50s]:  Thank you, candidate Leonida Siza.
[8620.50s - 8624.50s]:  Now it is the turn of candidate Victor Arauz who will answer in 90 seconds
[8624.50s - 8625.50s]:  the following question.
[8625.50s - 8626.50s]:  I read again.
[8626.50s - 8630.50s]:  The Ecuadorians have seen that the public forces often detain
[8630.50s - 8634.50s]:  criminals and judges release them for corruption or threats.
[8634.50s - 8639.50s]:  Specifically, how do you propose to depure and protect the administration of
[8639.50s - 8642.50s]:  justice if it affects the independence of powers of the state?
[8642.50s - 8644.50s]:  It runs its 90 seconds from now.
[8644.50s - 8648.50s]:  The judicial power has also been corrupted during all these times.
[8648.50s - 8652.50s]:  And what I am going to propose also includes the judicial function.
[8652.50s - 8655.50s]:  First, I will eliminate the rights of the criminals.
[8655.50s - 8657.50s]:  They should not have rights.
[8657.50s - 8661.50s]:  Second, I will build three large prisons and three cemeteries.
[8661.50s - 8663.50s]:  The message is clear.
[8663.50s - 8667.50s]:  Criminals to the prisons, murderers and rapists to the cemetery.
[8667.50s - 8670.50s]:  Third, I will fight illegal migration.
[8670.50s - 8674.50s]:  All illegal foreigners who are in the country will have 90 days to legalize
[8674.50s - 8675.50s]:  their situation.
[8675.50s - 8679.50s]:  On the contrary, they will be sent to their country of origin and we will demand
[8679.50s - 8682.50s]:  judicial past to enter Ecuador.
[8682.50s - 8686.50s]:  Fourth, I will create the National Security and Civil Protection Secretariat.
[8686.50s - 8691.50s]:  All institutions that fight against crime united with one goal.
[8691.50s - 8696.50s]:  To expel all criminals from the streets and prevent them from leaving the
[8696.50s - 8697.50s]:  prisons.
[8697.50s - 8701.50s]:  Fifth, police and military control in all ports and airports.
[8701.50s - 8707.50s]:  Sixth, I will free Ecuador from international treaties that prevent it from
[8707.50s - 8712.50s]:  applying the death penalty to atrocious crimes such as the chikareate and
[8712.50s - 8713.50s]:  rape.
[8713.50s - 8717.50s]:  But the most important thing is that in my government no policeman will be
[8717.50s - 8719.50s]:  afraid to shoot the criminals.
[8719.50s - 8721.50s]:  They will have all my support.
[8721.50s - 8722.50s]:  Thank you, candidate.
[8722.50s - 8726.50s]:  Arauz previously determined that the first interpellation will be carried out in
[8726.50s - 8727.50s]:  15 seconds.
[8727.50s - 8729.50s]:  Candidate Leonida Siza.
[8729.50s - 8730.50s]:  Corretiempo.
[8730.50s - 8738.50s]:  Estimado Arauz, en la zona 8 cuando usted fue jefe, ¿cómo permitieron que ingresen
[8738.50s - 8739.50s]:  las armas?
[8739.50s - 8741.50s]:  ¿Nos puede contar al Ecuador?
[8741.50s - 8745.50s]:  Candidato Víctor Arauz tiene 30 segundos para contestar ahora.
[8745.50s - 8749.50s]:  Mi gestión está plasmada en los números y en los resultados.
[8749.50s - 8754.50s]:  Fui uno de los comandantes de la zona 8 que dio el mejor atención a la seguridad
[8754.50s - 8756.50s]:  y a la protección ciudadana.
[8756.50s - 8760.50s]:  Acuérdese usted que todo lo que tiene que ver con el tema de las fronteras
[8760.50s - 8764.50s]:  también tiene que participar en este caso fuerzas armadas para evitar que el
[8764.50s - 8768.50s]:  armamento en este caso por la frontera sur ingrese al país.
[8768.50s - 8772.50s]:  Tuve los mejores resultados como comandante de la zona 8, como director de
[8772.50s - 8776.50s]:  la DINACET y como subdirector de inteligencia.
[8776.50s - 8780.50s]:  Candidato Víctor Arauz, el color de su tarjeta y su armamento en el caso de
[8780.50s - 8781.50s]:  la fronteras.
[8781.50s - 8785.50s]:  El color de su tarjeta es lila y corresponde que en esta segunda
[8785.50s - 8789.50s]:  interpelación sea el candidato Iván Saquicela quien haga la interpelación
[8789.50s - 8791.50s]:  en 15 segundos a partir de ahora.
[8791.50s - 8795.50s]:  Usted ha expresado que los criminales irán al cementerio.
[8795.50s - 8797.50s]:  Dígales por favor al Ecuador.
[8797.50s - 8799.50s]:  ¿Usted les va a matar?
[8799.50s - 8801.50s]:  ¿Va a ordenar matar?
[8801.50s - 8803.50s]:  ¿Cómo es su procedimiento?
[8803.50s - 8806.50s]:  Candidato Víctor Arauz tiene 30 segundos ahora.
[8807.50s - 8811.50s]:  Voy a proponer a nivel de la región que se presente ante los tratados
[8811.50s - 8816.50s]:  internacionales y con todos los presidentes proponer que se que se
[8816.50s - 8821.50s]:  analice la posibilidad de poner la pena de muerte en el Ecuador.
[8821.50s - 8825.50s]:  No se trata de ir a matar, se trata de defender al ciudadano de bien, a usted,
[8825.50s - 8829.50s]:  a todos los que están aquí, porque el Estado tiene la obligación de acabar
[8829.50s - 8833.50s]:  con la vida delincuente antes que el delincuente acabe con la vida del
[8833.50s - 8834.50s]:  ciudadano.
[8834.50s - 8837.50s]:  Ciudadano Armado terminará en el cementerio.
[8837.50s - 8839.50s]:  De esta manera termina.
[8839.50s - 8840.50s]:  Buenas noches.
[8840.50s - 8845.50s]:  En este momento ingresa al sed el doctor Marcos Camaño notario
[8845.50s - 8849.50s]:  cuadragésimo quinto de Pichincha para que los candidatos seleccionen al
[8849.50s - 8854.50s]:  azar los sobres que contienen las tarjetas de colores que se utilizarán
[8854.50s - 8859.50s]:  para la segunda interpelación del segundo eje temático.
[8859.50s - 8861.50s]:  Muchas gracias candidatos.
[8861.50s - 8865.50s]:  No habrá todavía los sobres, los sobres los vamos a abrir ya mismo
[8865.50s - 8870.50s]:  obviamente para que esto sea muy transparente y el público pueda
[8870.50s - 8871.50s]:  observarlos.
[8871.50s - 8875.50s]:  Así que guarden los sobres, ahí tienen la urna, un costado de la tril.
[8875.50s - 8878.50s]:  Gracias por seguir con nosotros, este es el debate presidencial obligatorio
[8878.50s - 8879.50s]:  2025.
[8879.50s - 8883.50s]:  Iniciamos ahora el desarrollo del segundo eje temático, eficiencia del
[8883.50s - 8888.50s]:  Estado y servicios públicos aplicando el mismo esquema y metodología del
[8888.50s - 8889.50s]:  primer eje.
[8889.50s - 8894.50s]:  Empezamos con usted candidato Enrique Gómez, va a tener 90 segundos para
[8894.50s - 8898.50s]:  responder a la siguiente pregunta de la franja dos, eje dos, eficiencia del
[8898.50s - 8900.50s]:  Estado y servicios públicos.
[8900.50s - 8903.50s]:  Como ustedes ven los sobres están totalmente cerrados.
[8903.50s - 8908.50s]:  Recibimos Obricio y yo antes de empezar precisamente el debate en sobres
[8908.50s - 8911.50s]:  cerrado ante la presencia de un notario.
[8911.50s - 8913.50s]:  La pregunta dice así.
[8913.50s - 8919.50s]:  Es responsabilidad del Estado prestar servicios públicos de calidad, pero en
[8919.50s - 8923.50s]:  el 2024 sufrimos apagones de hasta 14 horas diarias.
[8923.50s - 8927.50s]:  En su gobierno para garantizar la provisión de servicios públicos como
[8927.50s - 8929.50s]:  energía o salud.
[8929.50s - 8933.50s]:  Delegará su prestación al servicio privado o la economía popular y solidaria?
[8933.50s - 8937.50s]:  Tiene 90 segundos, corre en este momento.
[8937.50s - 8940.50s]:  Ni un cartón, ni un ladrón.
[8940.50s - 8945.50s]:  No podemos volver a un modelo que acaparó todos los poderes, pero que no
[8945.50s - 8947.50s]:  logró que su proyecto sea sostenible.
[8947.50s - 8953.50s]:  Y tampoco podemos ir al modelo actual, a la improvisación, al corre tratando de
[8953.50s - 8955.50s]:  llegar pero no lo alcanza.
[8955.50s - 8961.50s]:  Nuestro modelo plantea actuar de manera rápida y efectiva, garantizando que cada
[8961.50s - 8966.50s]:  ciudadano pueda acceder por un lado a servicios básicos, energía,
[8966.50s - 8971.50s]:  principalmente que tanto la necesita, pero por otro lado a la salud que tanta
[8971.50s - 8972.50s]:  falta nos hace.
[8972.50s - 8977.50s]:  Y es por eso que en el caso de salud vamos a mover mucho y muy rápido hacia
[8977.50s - 8978.50s]:  la telemedicina.
[8996.50s - 8997.50s]:  Gracias.
[9026.50s - 9027.50s]:  Gracias.
[9027.50s - 9028.50s]:  Gracias.
[9028.50s - 9029.50s]:  Gracias.
[9029.50s - 9030.50s]:  Gracias.
[9030.50s - 9031.50s]:  Gracias.
[9031.50s - 9032.50s]:  Gracias.
[9032.50s - 9033.50s]:  Gracias.

[9506.50s - 9507.50s]:  Thank you.
[9507.50s - 9512.42s]:  One question more, we'll make sure we don't forget that someone sometimes is walking
[9512.42s - 9519.02s]:  along the road and actually thought he heard something inside, because the sounds were
[9519.02s - 9520.18s]:  off.
[9520.18s - 9523.48s]:  I can hear that someone was walking over it.
[9523.48s - 9525.26s]:  We shot at it.
[9525.26s - 9527.40s]:  It was Mi'er.
[9527.40s - 9530.40s]:  If we destroy the lives of Ecuadorian families,
[9530.40s - 9535.40s]:  in terms of laws, in terms of security, in terms of lives,
[9535.40s - 9538.40s]:  the state's efficiency is to guarantee no more vaccines,
[9538.40s - 9540.40s]:  no more extortion, no more kidnapping.
[9540.40s - 9544.40s]:  That is the efficiency of the state, close to people.
[9545.40s - 9549.40s]:  Candidate Iván Zacisela, now you have the second interpellation.
[9549.40s - 9552.40s]:  Please, you have 15 seconds from now.
[9552.40s - 9555.40s]:  I am from the province of Lazoay and I don't get to the public work.
[9555.40s - 9558.40s]:  But the same thing happens in Amazon, in Chimborazo, in Tunguragua,
[9558.40s - 9560.40s]:  that is, the centralization.
[9560.40s - 9563.40s]:  What would you do to decentralize and democratize?
[9563.40s - 9567.40s]:  Candidate Carlos Carrabascal, you have to wait until I tell you, please,
[9567.40s - 9569.40s]:  when I mention it because it takes time.
[9569.40s - 9572.40s]:  Answer the second interpellation in 30 seconds.
[9572.40s - 9577.40s]:  One of the most important elements to guarantee the efficiency of the state
[9577.40s - 9580.40s]:  is to get out of that hypercentrallism that has killed us.
[9580.40s - 9584.40s]:  We have to go to a powerful decentralization plan.
[9584.40s - 9587.40s]:  We have to have autonomous, decentralized regimes.
[9587.40s - 9592.40s]:  Let a region group small, medium and large provinces.
[9592.40s - 9596.40s]:  With the administration of resources, governors, popular election.
[9596.40s - 9600.40s]:  And let me recover the possibility of developing the country.
[9601.40s - 9603.40s]:  Thank you, Candidate Carrabascal.
[9603.40s - 9605.40s]:  Now we continue with candidate Andrea González.
[9605.40s - 9607.40s]:  I recap the question.
[9607.40s - 9611.40s]:  It is the responsibility of the state to provide quality public services.
[9611.40s - 9615.40s]:  But in 2014 we suffered off-duty of up to 14 hours a day.
[9615.40s - 9617.40s]:  In your government, candidate González,
[9617.40s - 9621.40s]:  to guarantee the provision of public services such as energy or health.
[9621.40s - 9622.40s]:  Question.
[9622.40s - 9626.40s]:  Will you delegate your contribution to the private sector or to the popular and solidarity economy?
[9626.40s - 9629.40s]:  You have 90 seconds to answer.
[9629.40s - 9632.40s]:  We have to make a timeline of how we get to the state we are in.
[9632.40s - 9636.40s]:  And why, unlike Colombia and Peru, this global climate crisis
[9636.40s - 9639.40s]:  affected us much more than these neighboring countries.
[9639.40s - 9642.40s]:  In the government of Rafael Correa, SELEC is created.
[9642.40s - 9646.40s]:  And this begins to take all the business units in exchange for payments.
[9646.40s - 9648.40s]:  A great example of that is Ronny Aliaga,
[9648.40s - 9650.40s]:  known as the Latin King, an assemblyman for UNES,
[9650.40s - 9654.40s]:  who then thanks his step for an electric unit to Marcela Guiñaga,
[9654.40s - 9656.40s]:  current mayor of the same political project.
[9656.40s - 9658.40s]:  After the government of Lenin Moreno,
[9658.40s - 9661.40s]:  this is inflated with debt contracts in business units.
[9661.40s - 9665.40s]:  And finally, in the delasso with 3,792 debt contracts
[9665.40s - 9668.40s]:  that represent one billion dollars lost.
[9668.40s - 9670.40s]:  Efficiency, I know you didn't ask me,
[9670.40s - 9674.40s]:  but it means that resources are financially sustainable over time.
[9674.40s - 9678.40s]:  Not the white elephants like Yachaya, Costa, or Isquieta Perez.
[9678.40s - 9684.40s]:  Ecuador is estimated to have a deficit or need to produce 5,300 megawatts.
[9684.40s - 9687.40s]:  That speaks more or less of 1,500 megawatts of deficit.
[9687.40s - 9690.40s]:  And the leaching and drying can continue.
[9690.40s - 9693.40s]:  First of all, we cannot have all the hydroelectric plants connected
[9693.40s - 9695.40s]:  only with the eastern hydrological cycle.
[9695.40s - 9697.40s]:  That is, they depend on the Amazon.
[9697.40s - 9699.40s]:  We have to do some in the western zone,
[9699.40s - 9703.40s]:  like all the chip and tin that we continue to expect to build with surplus.
[9703.40s - 9705.40s]:  On the other hand, the thermoelectric plants,
[9705.40s - 9707.40s]:  although they are not friendly to the planet,
[9707.40s - 9709.40s]:  are the first part to be understood.
[9709.40s - 9713.40s]:  And countries like Ecuador should invest in long-term geothermal.
[9713.40s - 9715.40s]:  Thank you, candidate González.
[9715.40s - 9718.40s]:  The first interpellation to your answer will be done in 15 seconds.
[9718.40s - 9721.40s]:  Candidate Luisa González, the time is running now.
[9722.40s - 9725.40s]:  The state of function equally for all.
[9725.40s - 9729.40s]:  What opinion do you deserve that permits have been given
[9729.40s - 9732.40s]:  for a real estate project to the Balboneci estate
[9732.40s - 9734.40s]:  in a protected area like Olón?
[9734.40s - 9736.40s]:  You are an environmentalist.
[9736.40s - 9739.40s]:  Candidate Andrea González has 30 seconds to respond.
[9739.40s - 9741.40s]:  I was the first to report this in my tweet,
[9741.40s - 9745.40s]:  precisely from 5 to 6, from 24 to 11 in the morning.
[9745.40s - 9747.40s]:  And I believe because I have worked,
[9747.40s - 9751.40s]:  that non-governmental organizations can independently make themselves felt.
[9751.40s - 9754.40s]:  No difference for you that you politicize the tragedy of anyone
[9754.40s - 9756.40s]:  to have a little attention.
[9756.40s - 9758.40s]:  I do believe in the work of the people standing,
[9758.40s - 9761.40s]:  of the working people, and finally nothing happened in Olón.
[9761.40s - 9764.40s]:  But you did disappear in the San Rafael waterfall.
[9764.40s - 9766.40s]:  They invested 3,000 million in an electric hydropower
[9766.40s - 9768.40s]:  that Bloomberg today talks about a sinkhole.
[9768.40s - 9771.40s]:  Candidate Andrea González has a color match
[9771.40s - 9773.40s]:  with candidate Enrique Gómez,
[9773.40s - 9775.40s]:  who will formulate the second interpellation.
[9775.40s - 9777.40s]:  Go ahead, candidate, you have 15 seconds.
[9777.40s - 9781.40s]:  How much are you going to invest to guarantee the additional 500 megawatts
[9781.40s - 9784.40s]:  that the demand in Ecuador grows and additional?
[9784.40s - 9786.40s]:  How to release the environmental permits
[9786.40s - 9789.40s]:  that so many problems cause us in the Ministry of the Environment?
[9789.40s - 9792.40s]:  30 seconds to respond candidate Andrea González.
[9792.40s - 9794.40s]:  More than the Ministry of the Environment,
[9794.40s - 9797.40s]:  we are talking here about a constitution with a chavist soul,
[9797.40s - 9801.40s]:  that within the same law of organic hydrocarbons and the rest,
[9801.40s - 9803.40s]:  even for the oil issue,
[9803.40s - 9807.40s]:  the oil industry considers the participation of private companies exceptional.
[9807.40s - 9810.40s]:  This constitution, which has tied to the hands
[9810.40s - 9814.40s]:  the participation of the private company, healthy, not corrupt,
[9814.40s - 9817.40s]:  is what makes the big difference between Colombia and Peru
[9817.40s - 9819.40s]:  and how we face this crisis.
[9820.40s - 9824.40s]:  Candidate Pedro Granja, it is your turn to respond in 90 seconds.
[9824.40s - 9827.40s]:  The question that says, it is the responsibility of the State
[9827.40s - 9829.40s]:  to provide quality public services,
[9829.40s - 9833.40s]:  but in 2024 we suffer from outages of up to 14 hours a day.
[9833.40s - 9836.40s]:  In your government, to guarantee the provision of public services
[9836.40s - 9838.40s]:  such as energy or health,
[9838.40s - 9841.40s]:  will you delegate your contribution to the private service
[9841.40s - 9843.40s]:  or the popular and solidary economy?
[9843.40s - 9845.40s]:  Your 90 seconds run now.
[9845.40s - 9848.40s]:  Security, health and education are not privatized.
[9848.40s - 9851.40s]:  Yes, we will allow the participation of the private company,
[9851.40s - 9853.40s]:  fundamentally European,
[9853.40s - 9856.40s]:  in the construction of new wind farms.
[9856.40s - 9859.40s]:  Now, I have heard during this debate
[9859.40s - 9862.40s]:  one of the candidates speak without hesitation
[9862.40s - 9866.40s]:  of sending to the cemetery certain citizens
[9866.40s - 9868.40s]:  who would presumably have been delinquished.
[9868.40s - 9871.40s]:  But if for that same reason,
[9871.40s - 9873.40s]:  today we are crying the death of four children
[9873.40s - 9876.40s]:  murdered in a state crime in Tauras.
[9876.40s - 9879.40s]:  That is, when we talk about efficiency of public service,
[9879.40s - 9881.40s]:  this is important Ecuadorians,
[9881.40s - 9884.40s]:  I asked the question to two candidates and they did not answer me.
[9884.40s - 9886.40s]:  And this is the central line.
[9886.40s - 9890.40s]:  We are talking about a super concept that covers human talent,
[9890.40s - 9893.40s]:  infrastructure and permanence in time.
[9893.40s - 9895.40s]:  To start with the security issue,
[9895.40s - 9897.40s]:  which is a public service in general,
[9897.40s - 9901.40s]:  I will give way to all generals and colonels
[9901.40s - 9904.40s]:  of the police and the army.
[9904.40s - 9906.40s]:  Their substitutes will be chosen
[9906.40s - 9909.40s]:  with the help of Schengen and the United States.
[9909.40s - 9912.40s]:  Second, on the issue of public health service,
[9912.40s - 9914.40s]:  I will create the Ecuadorian MIR
[9914.40s - 9917.40s]:  with 14 medical specialties
[9917.40s - 9920.40s]:  in function of the mathematical modeling
[9920.40s - 9923.40s]:  of prevalent and contagious diseases.
[9923.40s - 9925.40s]:  We will also create the historical
[9925.40s - 9928.40s]:  first national mental health program.
[9928.40s - 9932.40s]:  We will hire a thousand psychologists and psychiatrists
[9932.40s - 9934.40s]:  so that they can attend to people in this.
[9934.40s - 9935.40s]:  That is ...
[9935.40s - 9937.40s]:  Your time is up, candidate Granja.
[9937.40s - 9939.40s]:  The first interpellation to your answer
[9939.40s - 9941.40s]:  will be done in 15 seconds.
[9941.40s - 9943.40s]:  Candidate Victor Arauz, your time is up.
[9943.40s - 9946.40s]:  Public services are a disaster to change this
[9946.40s - 9948.40s]:  and it takes knowledge, courage and above all,
[9948.40s - 9950.40s]:  to be in territory.
[9950.40s - 9952.40s]:  How do you plan to combat all these problems
[9952.40s - 9954.40s]:  if you have publicly said that you are afraid
[9954.40s - 9957.40s]:  to campaign in territory because you are afraid of threats?
[9957.40s - 9959.40s]:  Candidate Pedro Granja, please,
[9959.40s - 9960.40s]:  let's hope I tell you,
[9960.40s - 9962.40s]:  at the moment when time starts to run,
[9962.40s - 9964.40s]:  you have 30 seconds at this time.
[9964.40s - 9965.40s]:  Your time is up.
[9965.40s - 9969.40s]:  Yes, look, you say to defend the police
[9969.40s - 9972.40s]:  and your own troops will not vote for you.
[9972.40s - 9974.40s]:  It cannot be that during the entire campaign
[9974.40s - 9977.40s]:  I am the only person who says that a motorized policeman
[9977.40s - 9982.40s]:  earns $933 a day and from there he has to pay his ranch and uniform.
[9982.40s - 9985.40s]:  I am afraid because I am the one who has the greatest
[9985.40s - 9989.40s]:  threat index, unlike you, who is pure decoration.
[9989.40s - 9993.40s]:  Candidate Luisa González, you are going to make the second interpellation
[9993.40s - 9995.40s]:  to candidate Pedro Granja because the colors coincide.
[9995.40s - 9998.40s]:  You have 15 seconds from now.
[9999.40s - 10003.40s]:  What is your experience to be able to manage the state
[10003.40s - 10006.40s]:  and make it efficient and only to specify
[10006.40s - 10011.40s]:  that it is not the salary per day, but per month?
[10011.40s - 10014.40s]:  Candidate Pedro Granja, please answer.
[10014.40s - 10016.40s]:  What a wonderful question, Luisa.
[10016.40s - 10019.40s]:  I have clean hands and I have no experience.
[10019.40s - 10021.40s]:  The experience of stealing, the experience of lying,
[10021.40s - 10022.40s]:  I don't have that.
[10022.40s - 10025.40s]:  Yes, I am an academic, I am a university professor,
[10025.40s - 10027.40s]:  I am an anti-mafia expert, I graduated from the best
[10027.40s - 10031.40s]:  Italian universities with experience in the fight against
[10031.40s - 10034.40s]:  Andrangreta, against the crown of Unita and against
[10034.40s - 10037.40s]:  Ecuadorian drug traffickers who sent a cocaine kit
[10037.40s - 10039.40s]:  from the office to Italy.
[10039.40s - 10042.40s]:  In that I have a lot of experience, don't worry.
[10042.40s - 10044.40s]:  Thank you, candidate Ivan Zaquisela.
[10044.40s - 10046.40s]:  Now the question will answer.
[10046.40s - 10050.40s]:  Is it the responsibility of the state to provide quality public services?
[10050.40s - 10054.40s]:  But in 2014 we suffered from blackouts of up to 14 hours a day.
[10054.40s - 10057.40s]:  Candidate Zaquisela, in your government to guarantee
[10057.40s - 10060.40s]:  the provision of public services such as energy or health,
[10060.40s - 10063.40s]:  will you delegate your contribution to the private sector
[10063.40s - 10065.40s]:  or to the popular and solidarity economy?
[10065.40s - 10068.40s]:  You have 90 seconds to develop the answer.
[10068.40s - 10072.40s]:  A balanced proposal, no absolute statism,
[10072.40s - 10074.40s]:  nor the privilege of economic elites.
[10074.40s - 10078.40s]:  We are going with a public and private combination.
[10078.40s - 10082.40s]:  But something else, now that we are talking about this topic,
[10082.40s - 10083.40s]:  this is fundamental.
[10083.40s - 10087.40s]:  Who are we going to make the public administration with?
[10087.40s - 10092.40s]:  Young people, look me in the eyes, read me in my lips.
[10092.40s - 10095.40s]:  With you, it will be the public administration,
[10095.40s - 10099.40s]:  because the politicians of always closed the doors.
[10099.40s - 10103.40s]:  We are going to propose the first online university,
[10103.40s - 10107.40s]:  free internet for all students.
[10107.40s - 10111.40s]:  We are going to eliminate the Sercov, this has a lock on the country.
[10111.40s - 10114.40s]:  We are not going to forget the migrants,
[10114.40s - 10119.40s]:  we are going to fight to have the statute of temporary protection.
[10119.40s - 10121.40s]:  We are going for technology,
[10121.40s - 10125.40s]:  to point to science and technology with young people.
[10125.40s - 10128.40s]:  I will create the platform of efficiency of the state.
[10128.40s - 10132.40s]:  We are going to take Ecuador to the era of digitalization
[10132.40s - 10136.40s]:  to end the waste and tramitology.
[10136.40s - 10139.40s]:  I dream of an Ecuador where its nationalities,
[10139.40s - 10144.40s]:  peoples and communities have a government at their service.
[10144.40s - 10147.40s]:  With an Ecuador of dialogue and consensus,
[10147.40s - 10152.40s]:  where they are the route to make the impossible possible.
[10152.40s - 10155.40s]:  An Ecuador for all and for all.
[10155.40s - 10156.40s]:  Thank you candidate.
[10156.40s - 10159.40s]:  The first interpellation to candidate Iván Zaguicela
[10159.40s - 10161.40s]:  will be formulated by candidate Carlos Rabascal.
[10161.40s - 10164.40s]:  In 15 seconds, time runs now.
[10164.40s - 10167.40s]:  Mr. candidate, I was surprised that you,
[10167.40s - 10171.40s]:  being or having been president of the national court of justice,
[10171.40s - 10175.40s]:  within what is the issue of efficiency of the state,
[10175.40s - 10179.40s]:  have not said anything in relation to the elimination of the board of justice.
[10180.40s - 10181.40s]:  Thank you candidate.
[10181.40s - 10184.40s]:  Candidate Iván Zaguicela, in 30 seconds your answer.
[10184.40s - 10187.40s]:  We raise the disappearance of the board of justice.
[10187.40s - 10191.40s]:  I return to a supreme court of justice and a jurisdictional body
[10191.40s - 10193.40s]:  for the disciplinary regime.
[10193.40s - 10196.40s]:  It is fundamental not to get into the hands of justice.
[10196.40s - 10198.40s]:  All governments have done it.
[10198.40s - 10200.40s]:  Lucio Gutierrez brought us the pitch and cut.
[10200.40s - 10204.40s]:  Correismo was in the corridors of justice.
[10204.40s - 10206.40s]:  We are going to defend independence.
[10206.40s - 10208.40s]:  For whom? For citizens.
[10208.40s - 10211.40s]:  To make a truly democratic state
[10211.40s - 10215.40s]:  and the rights to be the daily life of each person.
[10215.40s - 10218.40s]:  The second interpellation will also be made by candidate Carlos Rabascal
[10218.40s - 10221.40s]:  because they coincide with the color of the cards.
[10221.40s - 10222.40s]:  Orange cards.
[10222.40s - 10224.40s]:  In 15 seconds, candidate Rabascal.
[10225.40s - 10229.40s]:  Mr. candidate, you have proposed a constituent assembly of full powers
[10229.40s - 10233.40s]:  because it says that you cannot govern with the constitution of 2008.
[10233.40s - 10236.40s]:  What would be the theme agenda of that constituent assembly?
[10237.40s - 10240.40s]:  Candidate Iván Zaguicela has 30 seconds to answer.
[10240.40s - 10244.40s]:  Three powers of the state, executive, legislative and judicial.
[10244.40s - 10245.40s]:  Nothing more.
[10245.40s - 10250.40s]:  We are going to reduce the number of assemblymen who will win by session.
[10250.40s - 10253.40s]:  We have to break with the centralist state,
[10253.40s - 10257.40s]:  with the authoritarian state, with hyper-presidentialism.
[10257.40s - 10260.40s]:  It is fundamental to achieve democracy.
[10260.40s - 10263.40s]:  Today there is a break in constitutional rules.
[10263.40s - 10265.40s]:  They do it today as they did in the past.
[10265.40s - 10268.40s]:  That is why we are going to the constituent assembly,
[10268.40s - 10270.40s]:  a deep reform of the country.
[10271.40s - 10273.40s]:  Candidate Leonida Giza, it is your turn.
[10273.40s - 10277.40s]:  I am going to read the question again because this is how the settlement of the national debate committee is established.
[10277.40s - 10281.40s]:  It is the responsibility of the state to provide quality public services,
[10281.40s - 10284.40s]:  but in 2024 we suffer off-duty of up to 14 hours a day.
[10284.40s - 10288.40s]:  In your government, to guarantee the provision of public services
[10288.40s - 10290.40s]:  such as energy or health,
[10290.40s - 10295.40s]:  will you delegate your contribution to private service or the popular and solidarity economy?
[10295.40s - 10296.40s]:  You have 90 seconds.
[10296.40s - 10297.40s]:  You have time.
[10298.40s - 10299.40s]:  What an outrage!
[10299.40s - 10304.40s]:  They screwed up the country, they confused efficiency with privatizations
[10304.40s - 10306.40s]:  and destroyed public service.
[10306.40s - 10311.40s]:  In our government, we will only delegate to the popular and solidarity economy.
[10311.40s - 10315.40s]:  I want to tell you that the health of the public health system and the IES,
[10315.40s - 10317.40s]:  which is for workers,
[10317.40s - 10320.40s]:  has to respect the law and the budgetary assignment.
[10320.40s - 10325.40s]:  How can we continue to allow our Ecuadorians to lose their lives
[10325.40s - 10329.40s]:  because of the lack of medicines and lack of attention?
[10329.40s - 10332.40s]:  When we have the cheapest medicine in the world,
[10332.40s - 10336.40s]:  we can double the purchasing capacity and provide better coverage.
[10336.40s - 10341.40s]:  We tell you that private insurance companies will also provide coverage
[10341.40s - 10343.40s]:  for catastrophic diseases.
[10343.40s - 10349.40s]:  The education system must guarantee quality for our children and adolescents.
[10349.40s - 10354.40s]:  For this, teachers with decent salaries, school meals and benefits.
[10354.40s - 10358.40s]:  We will return the budget of the country to public universities
[10358.40s - 10361.40s]:  to expand the budget and provide quality education to our young people.
[10361.40s - 10363.40s]:  The light for all.
[10363.40s - 10367.40s]:  We will maintain hydroelectric and thermoelectric power plants.
[10367.40s - 10371.40s]:  For emergency, we will immediately put 700 million dollars.
[10371.40s - 10373.40s]:  Rights for all.
[10373.40s - 10375.40s]:  Our retired, our older adults.
[10375.40s - 10377.40s]:  Universal retirement.
[10377.40s - 10380.40s]:  Rights for women. No more violence.
[10380.40s - 10382.40s]:  I want to say with absolute category,
[10382.40s - 10385.40s]:  public services are sacred.
[10385.40s - 10387.40s]:  We will not allow privatization.
[10387.40s - 10388.40s]:  Thank you, candidate Isa.
[10388.40s - 10390.40s]:  Candidate Isa, the first interpellation in response,
[10390.40s - 10392.40s]:  will be done in 15 seconds.
[10392.40s - 10394.40s]:  Candidate Iván Saquicela.
[10394.40s - 10395.40s]:  Now.
[10395.40s - 10399.40s]:  Our dear old men who are abandoned,
[10399.40s - 10403.40s]:  they deserve to be honored by all Ecuadorians.
[10403.40s - 10407.40s]:  What will you do for them in the framework of public service?
[10407.40s - 10411.40s]:  Candidate Leonidas Isa has 30 seconds to answer the first interpellation.
[10411.40s - 10412.40s]:  Now.
[10412.40s - 10415.40s]:  At this moment, I have presented it to the country.
[10415.40s - 10417.40s]:  Universal retirement.
[10417.40s - 10420.40s]:  It cannot be that after working so long,
[10420.40s - 10421.40s]:  so many years,
[10421.40s - 10426.40s]:  that they have to die in communities with a pound of magic and a piece of candy.
[10426.40s - 10429.40s]:  Let us honor our Taitas, Mamas, Grandfathers,
[10429.40s - 10433.40s]:  who have worked for this country and have sustained the real economy,
[10433.40s - 10434.40s]:  not the financial one.
[10434.40s - 10439.40s]:  Candidate Leonidas Isa, the sobre elegido by you had the brown card
[10439.40s - 10441.40s]:  and coincides with the candidate Victor Arauz,
[10441.40s - 10444.40s]:  who will perform the second interpellation in 15 seconds.
[10444.40s - 10445.40s]:  Now.
[10445.40s - 10446.40s]:  Candidate Isa,
[10446.40s - 10451.40s]:  you have been led by years of protests that have affected public and private goods.
[10451.40s - 10454.40s]:  What is your plan to be able to offer quality public services,
[10454.40s - 10459.40s]:  if you have been the main protagonist of the disorder and chaos and destruction
[10459.40s - 10461.40s]:  of those public goods and services?
[10461.40s - 10464.40s]:  Candidate Leonidas Isa, please answer.
[10464.40s - 10468.40s]:  Precisely to protect public services,
[10468.40s - 10475.40s]:  which the political and economic elite of this country want and have managed to privatize some sectors,
[10475.40s - 10477.40s]:  we have had to go out into the streets.
[10477.40s - 10478.40s]:  Now it is.
[10478.40s - 10484.40s]:  At least we put 200 million dollars in those mobilizations that you call violence.
[10484.40s - 10486.40s]:  Violence is not having bread every day,
[10486.40s - 10488.40s]:  not having medicines in hospitals.
[10488.40s - 10491.40s]:  That is violence that they have caused in this country.
[10491.40s - 10493.40s]:  Thank you, Candidate Leonidas Isa.
[10493.40s - 10497.40s]:  To close this block, we are going to listen to the answer of the candidate Victor Arauz.
[10497.40s - 10501.40s]:  It is the responsibility of the state to provide quality public services,
[10501.40s - 10505.40s]:  but in 2024 we suffer off-duty of up to 14 hours a day.
[10505.40s - 10506.40s]:  Candidate Arauz,
[10506.40s - 10511.40s]:  in your government to guarantee the provision of public services such as energy or health,
[10511.40s - 10515.40s]:  will you delegate the loan to the private sector or to the popular and solidarity economy?
[10515.40s - 10517.40s]:  You have 90 seconds to respond.
[10517.40s - 10521.40s]:  It is necessary to give efficiency to all public services.
[10521.40s - 10524.40s]:  I will keep the thermoelectric plants permanent
[10524.40s - 10529.40s]:  to avoid falling into the problems of energy that we have had at this time.
[10530.40s - 10532.40s]:  In health, the first and most important thing,
[10532.40s - 10535.40s]:  free and quality medicine for all Ecuadorians.
[10535.40s - 10538.40s]:  A patient will never die in a hospital in the country.
[10538.40s - 10543.40s]:  In education, the children of Ecuador, I will give them breakfast, lunch,
[10543.40s - 10545.40s]:  useful school supplies and free uniforms.
[10545.40s - 10547.40s]:  I will reform the educational system.
[10547.40s - 10549.40s]:  We will start from scratch.
[10549.40s - 10557.40s]:  I will give priority to education in values, responsibility, honesty, honor, justice, discipline,
[10557.40s - 10561.40s]:  and to make them the basis for the family and a better society.
[10561.40s - 10564.40s]:  And most importantly, listen to me well, Ecuadorians,
[10564.40s - 10567.40s]:  I will not allow gender ideology in schools.
[10567.40s - 10571.40s]:  If you mess with the family and the children, you mess with me.
[10571.40s - 10579.40s]:  I will also do everything necessary to promote and grow the IES.
[10579.40s - 10583.40s]:  I will propose a constitutional reform to provide the money
[10583.40s - 10586.40s]:  of the Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security.
[10586.40s - 10590.40s]:  Never again will a government put the money of affiliates in your hands.
[10590.40s - 10592.40s]:  That money is sacred.
[10592.40s - 10595.40s]:  That is why I will invest that money in the best way
[10595.40s - 10598.40s]:  so that the benefit is for each of the affiliates.
[10599.40s - 10600.40s]:  Thank you, candidate.
[10600.40s - 10603.40s]:  The first interruption to your answer will be made in 15 seconds.
[10603.40s - 10606.40s]:  Candidate Leonida Siza, time is running out.
[10607.40s - 10611.40s]:  To guarantee the efficiency of the state, it is essential to fight corruption.
[10611.40s - 10617.40s]:  You have a candidate who is presumed to be linked to Leandro Norero.
[10617.40s - 10619.40s]:  What will you do if he wins?
[10619.40s - 10622.40s]:  Candidate Victor Arauz, your answer in 30 seconds.
[10622.40s - 10627.40s]:  There are 500 or more candidates for the National Assembly.
[10627.40s - 10630.40s]:  They were chosen in this case by the party.
[10630.40s - 10637.40s]:  I am not the president or the one who directs the people who will participate in these elections.
[10637.40s - 10642.40s]:  When I found out, I was the frontman and I asked that person to leave the party.
[10642.40s - 10643.40s]:  And it was done.
[10643.40s - 10646.40s]:  Because I am a person who practices what he predicts.
[10646.40s - 10653.40s]:  And I will always be firm in any situation that puts doubt on the transparency of the political party.
[10654.40s - 10655.40s]:  Thank you, candidate.
[10655.40s - 10657.40s]:  Obviously the same interaction is repeated.
[10657.40s - 10660.40s]:  Question from candidate Leonida Siza.
[10660.40s - 10662.40s]:  Answer from candidate Arauz because the cards match.
[10662.40s - 10664.40s]:  Candidate Siza, you have 15 seconds.
[10664.40s - 10667.40s]:  Mrs. Arauz, the farmers...
[10667.40s - 10669.40s]:  Agriculture in times of pandemic.
[10669.40s - 10674.40s]:  We will give them the impulse, we will give them the credits to the small and large farmers.
[10674.40s - 10677.40s]:  So that they can produce and above all, we will give them security.
[10677.40s - 10683.40s]:  So that they can take out all their products and not be victims of kidnappers and vaccinators.
[10683.40s - 10685.40s]:  Thank you, candidates.
[10685.40s - 10689.40s]:  In this way, we finish the second issue of the presidential debate 2025.
[10689.40s - 10692.40s]:  Moment of a new informative pause.
[10692.40s - 10693.40s]:  We return to it.
[10694.40s - 10695.40s]:  Thank you.
[10724.40s - 10725.40s]:  Thank you.
[10754.40s - 10755.40s]:  Thank you.
[10784.40s - 10787.40s]:  It is totally closed, candidates.
[10787.40s - 10789.40s]:  Let's open it then.
[10789.40s - 10793.40s]:  And candidate Enrique Gomez starts answering in 90 seconds the following question.
[10793.40s - 10795.40s]:  What does it say?
[10795.40s - 10802.40s]:  Ecuador closes 2024 with a fiscal deficit of around 4 billion dollars.
[10802.40s - 10809.40s]:  To solve that deficit, will you reduce expenses and subsidies or increase debt and taxes?
[10809.40s - 10812.40s]:  Your 90 seconds run now.
[10812.40s - 10814.40s]:  Neither a card nor a thief.
[10814.40s - 10819.40s]:  Neither a card that improvises and lies to us with numbers and says we are better than before.
[10819.40s - 10823.40s]:  Nor a thief that the government steals from private investment.
[10823.40s - 10830.40s]:  We need to create a model that guarantees long-term development for the Ecuadorians.
[10830.40s - 10838.40s]:  Strengthening fishing, strengthening agriculture, strengthening mining, strengthening our oil extraction.
[10838.40s - 10843.40s]:  But always respecting, and above all, environmental sustainability.
[10843.40s - 10849.40s]:  Because for that, our interrelation with the environment will be a priority.
[10849.40s - 10857.40s]:  We have to sign agreements, as already signed with Korea, that want to invest in the long term and in short and low interests.
[10857.40s - 10864.40s]:  So that each young man, each entrepreneur who wants to move forward can develop a country in the long term.
[10864.40s - 10867.40s]:  We have to guarantee security for that too.
[10867.40s - 10871.40s]:  Last year I was shot, as a result of stealing my backpack.
[10897.40s - 10899.40s]:  Thank you.
[10927.40s - 10929.40s]:  Thank you.
[10929.40s - 10931.40s]:  Thank you.
[10931.40s - 10933.40s]:  Thank you.
[10961.40s - 10963.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10963.40s - 10965.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10965.40s - 10967.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10967.40s - 10969.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10969.40s - 10971.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10971.40s - 10973.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10973.40s - 10975.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10975.40s - 10977.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10977.40s - 10979.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10979.40s - 10981.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10981.40s - 10983.40s]:  Candidate Aragos, please raise the cards.
[10983.40s - 10985.40s]:  Candidate Andres, please raise the cards.
[10985.40s - 10987.40s]:  Candidate Andres, please raise the cards.
[10987.40s - 10989.40s]:  Candidate Andres, please raise the cards.
[10989.60s - 10991.60s]:  Candidate Andres, please raise the cards.
[10993.60s - 10995.60s]:  Candidate Andres, processes.
[10995.60s - 11004.60s]:  Let us ask the people of Ecuador
[11004.60s - 11010.60s]:  to remain at home,
[11011.70s - 11015.22s]:  they're home, because they've been 뭔가
[11015.22s - 11017.22s]:  has brought on,
[11017.22s - 11024.22s]:  dignified, safe, that allow us to bring to our families all the resources necessary to be able to live better.
[11024.22s - 11031.22s]:  This is a priority that during my government will be guaranteed to each Ecuadorian from each space,
[11031.22s - 11037.22s]:  improving our quality of life and guaranteeing a future worthy for each Ecuadorian.
[11037.22s - 11042.22s]:  Thank you candidate. Now it's the turn of candidate Luisa Gonzalez.
[11042.22s - 11049.22s]:  The question for this issue. Ecuador closes 2024 with a fiscal deficit of around 4 billion dollars.
[11049.22s - 11058.22s]:  To solve this deficit, you candidate will reduce expenses and subsidies or increase debt and taxes?
[11058.22s - 11061.22s]:  Luisa Gonzalez has 90 seconds from this moment.
[11061.22s - 11069.22s]:  The only mechanism to solve the deficit is with sustained economic growth. More sales, more collection.
[11069.22s - 11077.22s]:  I'm not lying. I'm not going to raise more taxes like the IBA, which they raised to 15% and the three additional points
[11077.22s - 11083.22s]:  said it was to guarantee security. And I ask the Ecuadorians, do you feel safer? No, right?
[11083.22s - 11088.22s]:  Because eight out of every ten dollars collected are sent out of the country.
[11088.22s - 11095.22s]:  Now, what am I going to do? We have to put money in the pockets of the Ecuadorians, generating employment.
[11095.22s - 11105.22s]:  First, efficient public investment in roads and housing. Second, productive credit for entrepreneurs, women, young people
[11105.22s - 11114.22s]:  at an interest rate of 7.5%. We also need to strengthen farmers, fishermen, artisans,
[11114.22s - 11121.22s]:  the popular economy and solidarity with preferential credit of 5%. But it's not just about creating employment.
[11121.22s - 11128.22s]:  Employment is a dignified job with affiliation with IES and with the inclusion of our brothers with special capacities.
[11128.22s - 11137.22s]:  This is how we are going to reactivate the economy and employment. Additionally, it is important to guarantee that services are of quality
[11137.22s - 11144.22s]:  and that we work together and united. Thus, we will revive the economy and employment in the Ecuador.
[11144.22s - 11151.22s]:  Thank you. The first question is from Luisa González. The answer is from Ivan Sagicela in 15 seconds.
[11151.22s - 11153.22s]:  Candidate, your time is running.
[11153.22s - 11158.22s]:  There is no way to achieve development if corruption is not fought. You said you would free GLAS.
[11158.22s - 11165.22s]:  What is the legal way to do this? Don't lie. Tell Ecuador. Tell them in a clear and concrete way,
[11165.22s - 11168.22s]:  but tell the Ecuadorians.
[11168.22s - 11172.22s]:  Thank you, Candidate Sagicela. Candidate Luisa González has 30 seconds.
[11172.22s - 11178.22s]:  Let's talk about the economy. I will fight against criminal economies financed by corrupt judges
[11178.22s - 11181.22s]:  that free drug traffickers and plant terror on us.
[11181.22s - 11187.22s]:  Alias Rasquiña, you freed them. You freed them and planted terror on us.
[11187.22s - 11194.22s]:  How did you finance those judges that later fail in favor of criminals like Rasquiña,
[11194.22s - 11197.22s]:  who freed you in 2018?
[11197.22s - 11199.22s]:  As a result...
[11200.22s - 11205.22s]:  As a result of the color coincidences, the candidate Ivan Sagicela will be again intervened.
[11205.22s - 11208.22s]:  Candidate Luisa González has 15 seconds. Candidate Sagicela.
[11208.22s - 11214.22s]:  I have never freed any drug trafficker. I never contained his leader.
[11214.22s - 11218.22s]:  And for me and for Ivan Sagicela, today I tweet from a Dune.
[11218.22s - 11223.22s]:  Tell Ecuador what to do for the state because it is a judicial disposition.
[11223.22s - 11226.22s]:  Candidate Luisa González has 30 seconds to answer.
[11227.22s - 11233.22s]:  Once again, explain to Ecuador how you freed Alias Rasquiña,
[11233.22s - 11237.22s]:  who plants terror on us and was murdered in Manta.
[11237.22s - 11241.22s]:  You freed him. You explain that to Ecuadorians.
[11241.22s - 11247.22s]:  Dear Ecuadorians, corrupt judges that free criminals is what we will fight
[11247.22s - 11250.22s]:  through the Activos Washed Unit.
[11250.22s - 11252.22s]:  Explain it to them. And if not, google it right now.
[11252.22s - 11256.22s]:  Investigate who freed Alias Rasquiña. Who was the judge, Mr. Sagicela?
[11256.22s - 11257.22s]:  You were.
[11259.22s - 11263.22s]:  Candidate Carlos Ravascal, now it is your turn to answer the question.
[11263.22s - 11270.22s]:  What does it say? Ecuador closes 2024 with a fiscal deficit of around $4 billion.
[11270.22s - 11277.22s]:  To solve that deficit, will you reduce expenses and subsidies or increase debt and taxes?
[11277.22s - 11279.22s]:  You have 90 seconds. Go ahead.
[11279.22s - 11285.22s]:  No more economic, neoliberal policies that take away money from people.
[11285.22s - 11294.22s]:  It takes away money from education, health, security, the energy sector and the entire Ecuadorian people.
[11294.22s - 11301.22s]:  We have to work on a social economic development model.
[11301.22s - 11305.22s]:  Hypercentralism has hurt us.
[11305.22s - 11309.22s]:  I have spoken that we have to go to the centralised autonomous regions.
[11309.22s - 11313.22s]:  I speak to you, people from the different provinces of Ecuador.
[11313.22s - 11320.22s]:  I do not want more mayors and mayors to be beggared by the Minister of Economy on duty.
[11320.22s - 11328.22s]:  You have to manage your resources, recover the productive funding, generate your wealth and generate work.
[11328.22s - 11333.22s]:  We will rescue the rural sector and we will return it to a powerful development pole
[11333.22s - 11339.22s]:  through economic models that are supportive, cooperative in production, commerce and service.
[11339.22s - 11343.22s]:  We will inject money into the economy by activating the payment chains.
[11343.22s - 11347.22s]:  We will activate the state bank to finance drinking water projects,
[11347.22s - 11353.22s]:  water pipes, electricity, electricity and irrigation.
[11353.22s - 11360.22s]:  Additionally, we will facilitate private investment by encouraging the productive sector
[11360.22s - 11365.22s]:  to finance national road projects such as the Guayaquil-Quito highway.
[11365.22s - 11370.22s]:  The first question is answered in 15 seconds.
[11370.22s - 11372.22s]:  Candidate Andrea Gonzalez, go ahead.
[11372.22s - 11380.22s]:  Carlos, in your government plan you say that the policies you propose are aimed at strengthening the role of the state
[11380.22s - 11383.22s]:  while recognizing the importance of a regulated market.
[11383.22s - 11387.22s]:  My proposal for a liberal economy, do you agree with yours?
[11387.22s - 11391.22s]:  Candidate Carlos Ravascal has 30 seconds to answer. Go ahead.
[11391.22s - 11398.22s]:  The role of the state is tremendously important because it has to take care of the well-being of the Ecuadorian families.
[11398.22s - 11408.22s]:  This does not mean a state of that. This means a powerful state, a strong state, an efficient, efficient and above all, solidary state.
[11408.22s - 11413.22s]:  It has to guarantee the dignity of that people.
[11413.22s - 11418.22s]:  Candidate Carlos Ravascal, candidate Gonzalez has the color of the card.
[11418.22s - 11422.22s]:  She will answer in 15 seconds. Go ahead.
[11422.22s - 11426.22s]:  My generation has only witnessed inefficient, obese states
[11426.22s - 11433.22s]:  and that have invested our non-renewable resources in personal, political and egocentric projects.
[11433.22s - 11436.22s]:  Instead of getting us out of the way, how can we believe it will be different this time?
[11436.22s - 11439.22s]:  Candidate Ravascal has 30 seconds.
[11439.22s - 11442.22s]:  What has to be different, candidate Gonzalez?
[11442.22s - 11448.22s]:  Look, that austerity policy that has governed us in the last seven years,
[11448.22s - 11452.22s]:  does it take away the money from everyone? And does it affect the rights of the Ecuadorians?
[11452.22s - 11457.22s]:  Or did it not take away the money from the energy sector when it had to grow in energy?
[11457.22s - 11462.22s]:  Or has it not taken away the money from health and security itself?
[11462.22s - 11468.22s]:  In other words, it is enough to believe that austerity models lead to development.
[11468.22s - 11470.22s]:  Thank you, candidate Ravascal.
[11470.22s - 11473.22s]:  It is the turn of candidate Andrea Gonzalez with the question of this issue.
[11473.22s - 11478.22s]:  Ecuador closes 2024 with a fiscal deficit of around $4 billion.
[11478.22s - 11484.22s]:  To solve this deficit, will you, candidate, reduce expenses and subsidies?
[11484.22s - 11489.22s]:  Will you increase debt and taxes? You have 90 seconds to answer.
[11489.22s - 11495.22s]:  Of course, the proposal of a liberal economy talks about reducing the inefficient state expenses.
[11495.22s - 11500.22s]:  We have already made it very clear that the 20 ministries that are necessary in Ecuador,
[11500.22s - 11504.22s]:  the 40 ministries that we have during the 21st century socialism, are worse.
[11504.22s - 11512.22s]:  On the other hand, we have a constitution that has a deep Chavista soul and a hug to the brave people of Venezuela who fight against a dictator.
[11512.22s - 11515.22s]:  But we have to understand that Venezuela can print Bolívares,
[11515.22s - 11521.22s]:  unlike a country like Ecuador that is dollarized and needs the income of these debts.
[11521.22s - 11527.22s]:  With this constitution of Chavista soul and a weak state, we will never be able to get out of the underdevelopment.
[11527.22s - 11535.22s]:  Not only that we do not grow, but that if we grow by 1% it would take us 100 years to be with this Chile.
[11535.22s - 11539.22s]:  Ecuador has 10 years of oil abundance left.
[11539.22s - 11545.22s]:  And this wonderful idea of planting oil is not said by an engineer in the environment, and I do not correct that, I am not an environmentalist,
[11546.22s - 11551.22s]:  but it was said by General Rodriguez Lara who was very clear that oil is investment.
[11551.22s - 11559.22s]:  It is over that these political projects that are being carried out in Carondelet use our non-renewable resources for current spending.
[11559.22s - 11567.22s]:  Non-renewable resources must be investment to be able to generate an ecosystem where investing in agricultural technology and education,
[11567.22s - 11572.22s]:  we create more jobs that can give us taxes to live in a healthy state.
[11572.22s - 11578.22s]:  Thank you candidate, the first interpellation will be made by the candidate Victor Arauz, you have 15 seconds, run the time.
[11578.22s - 11584.22s]:  Ecuador faces the worst crisis in homicides, extortions and kidnappings in Latin America,
[11584.22s - 11586.22s]:  which affect the work and productivity of the country.
[11586.22s - 11594.22s]:  How and in how long will you solve this problem that does not allow the development and economic development of the country?
[11594.22s - 11598.22s]:  Thank you candidate Victor Arauz, candidate Andrea González, in 30 seconds your answer please.
[11599.22s - 11606.22s]:  We have to understand that the citizen revolution took away from our young people from 16 years ago the entry into a healthy job ecosystem.
[11606.22s - 11610.22s]:  Let us remember that the past few years were before the age of high school.
[11610.22s - 11616.22s]:  Choosing a specialized high school made you much more productive because you entered the university knowing that you wanted to study.
[11616.22s - 11621.22s]:  It would have been impossible for me to study engineering in the environment without having seen 8 hours of chemistry a week.
[11621.22s - 11625.22s]:  We propose the recovery of our young people with an active economy from high school.
[11626.22s - 11633.22s]:  Thank you candidate, the second interpellation will be made by candidate Carlos Ravascal for the coincidence of colors.
[11633.22s - 11636.22s]:  Candidate Ravascal has 15 seconds.
[11636.22s - 11647.22s]:  Candidate Andrea González, how would you optimize the expense considering that you have put as an example the policy My Law,
[11647.22s - 11651.22s]:  when in the policy My Law practically the expense is reduced?
[11651.22s - 11655.22s]:  Thank you candidate, candidate Andrea González has 30 seconds to answer.
[11655.22s - 11659.22s]:  This is not the plan of My Law nor the plan of anyone but Andrea González Nader.
[11659.22s - 11668.22s]:  I have sat with the productive sectors and we know that the future post-oil worker of this country is through the efficiency and investment of our non-renewable resources.
[11668.22s - 11674.22s]:  That is why our plan PAPA, although everyone now puts names to the plans, the plan of support for the agricultural producer,
[11674.22s - 11681.22s]:  talks about a future post-oil worker efficient. Only cocoa increased almost 172% of its exports.
[11681.22s - 11686.22s]:  I do not go back to the field, it is my promise for a better future for this country.
[11686.22s - 11690.22s]:  Thank you candidate González, now it is the turn of candidate Pedro Granja.
[11690.22s - 11693.22s]:  To the next question will have 90 seconds to answer.
[11693.22s - 11699.22s]:  Ecuador closes 2024 with a fiscal deficit of around 4 billion dollars.
[11699.22s - 11705.22s]:  To solve this deficit, will you reduce expenses and subsidies or increase debt and taxes?
[11705.22s - 11712.22s]:  I will charge the 4 billion dollars that the evasive groups of taxes in this country owe.
[11712.22s - 11718.22s]:  The group Novoa, the group Topic, the group One will have to pay taxes immediately.
[11718.22s - 11724.22s]:  The second, we have 6,700 million dollars in the international reserve.
[11724.22s - 11729.22s]:  What do Ecuadorians prefer? A redistribution of income, that improves their salaries,
[11729.22s - 11734.22s]:  that there are more people working for the state or that that money is stolen by the politicians of always?
[11734.22s - 11738.22s]:  I do not agree with my dear Andrea when she talks about reducing the size of the state.
[11738.22s - 11743.22s]:  Reducing the size of the state means more dismissals, less people working.
[11743.22s - 11750.22s]:  When we are going to get the cell, there is only one person in a cube working and there are five more empty cubes.
[11750.22s - 11755.22s]:  There are five people who could be working and we could get the cell in just five minutes.
[11755.22s - 11758.22s]:  I think there is a very important issue.
[11758.22s - 11760.22s]:  I have defended children who are victims of abuse all my life.
[11760.22s - 11766.22s]:  Children who are victims of abuse today do not have shadow teachers in the school and they have to leave the school.
[11766.22s - 11773.22s]:  I think we have to hire at least 2,000 teachers in the first year of my government so that they can help these people.
[11773.22s - 11776.22s]:  Unfortunately, time does not help us.
[11776.22s - 11780.22s]:  We are going to deliver 10,000 homes in the first year.
[11780.22s - 11789.22s]:  If five people work for each home, we will have guaranteed work for 50,000 people during the four years of my government.
[11789.22s - 11793.22s]:  Thank you candidate. Enrique Gomez will be the candidate who will interrupt you in 15 seconds.
[11793.22s - 11795.22s]:  Please go ahead, run time.
[11795.22s - 11799.22s]:  Candidate, you indicate that you are going to bring 3,500 of those 6,700.
[11799.22s - 11803.22s]:  If only 700 are from the state, who are you going to help?
[11803.22s - 11808.22s]:  I am going to ask the people who have been the depositors of that money.
[11808.22s - 11812.22s]:  Candidate Pedro Granja has 30 seconds from now.
[11812.22s - 11813.22s]:  It is a wonderful question.
[11813.22s - 11817.22s]:  We only have to leave 30% to guarantee banking.
[11817.22s - 11820.22s]:  The rest of the money is from the Ecuadorians.
[11820.22s - 11831.22s]:  And since money does not grow in trees, it must be brought for educational, social and environmental development projects that allow to eliminate social asymmetry and reduce violence.
[11831.22s - 11836.22s]:  Candidate Pedro Granja, your color card coincides with that of candidate Enrique Gomez.
[11836.22s - 11839.22s]:  Candidate, please, your interpellation in 15 seconds.
[11839.22s - 11840.22s]:  Run time.
[11840.22s - 11849.22s]:  Consider it appropriate to restructure the state, defining that we maintain a linear budget and not for objectives, guaranteeing better attention to the Ecuadorians.
[11849.22s - 11853.22s]:  Candidate, you have to wait for me to tell you please why the time is running.
[11853.22s - 11856.22s]:  Please continue. Go ahead.
[11857.22s - 11865.22s]:  Here it seems to me that the most important thing is to define how we are going to finance the projects of each of our government plans.
[11865.22s - 11870.22s]:  There is a lot of talk of the tax deficit, but the money is not charged to the big tax evaders.
[11870.22s - 11875.22s]:  And the second thing is, if we have to eliminate expenses, let's start with the guidelines, for example.
[11875.22s - 11882.22s]:  Let's start with that troll center that is currently inciting the networks and calling for more violence at such a critical time for the country.
[11882.22s - 11884.22s]:  It seems to me that that's where the point is.
[11884.22s - 11888.22s]:  It's a shame that this debate is not a debate because it really is a caricature.
[11888.22s - 11891.22s]:  Thank you, candidate Pedro Granja, candidate Iván Zaguisela.
[11891.22s - 11896.22s]:  Ecuador closes 2024 with a tax deficit of around $4 billion.
[11896.22s - 11903.22s]:  To solve that deficit, will you reduce your expenses or subsidies or increase your debt and taxes?
[11903.22s - 11906.22s]:  You have 90 seconds to argue.
[11906.22s - 11910.22s]:  I want a decent person, said Correa, before I condemn him.
[11910.22s - 11917.22s]:  That's why we're going to start with the OSICO, which is Organism Against Impurity and Organized Crime.
[11917.22s - 11919.22s]:  But let's start with the economic.
[11919.22s - 11924.22s]:  First, collection centers and distribution markets, food from the producer to the consumer.
[11924.22s - 11928.22s]:  Second, healthy and economic food cards.
[11928.22s - 11933.22s]:  What for? To have fair prices and activate local production chains.
[11933.22s - 11935.22s]:  Third, let's start with credit.
[11935.22s - 11940.22s]:  We have a project that we call REI, immediate economic reactivation.
[11940.22s - 11946.22s]:  Credit of up to 4% with a 10-year term and with technical assistance.
[11946.22s - 11949.22s]:  Women, this is not an ideology.
[11949.22s - 11952.22s]:  We are going to prioritize credit from woman to woman.
[11952.22s - 11957.22s]:  It will be in charge here in Ecuador, Maria Luisa Cuello, my vice president.
[11957.22s - 11964.22s]:  And the millennial credit, young people, we are going to financially support their dreams.
[11964.22s - 11968.22s]:  My daughters, Camila and Mar Emilia, who are watching me, will support me.
[11968.22s - 11973.22s]:  Let's work to achieve economic development.
[11973.22s - 11976.22s]:  This dichotomy cannot be put into place.
[11976.22s - 11978.22s]:  Or subsidies or debts.
[11978.22s - 11983.22s]:  What it is about is public investment, private investment, to boost the economy.
[11983.22s - 11987.22s]:  And with that, when there is economy, when there is investment, there is employment.
[11987.22s - 11990.22s]:  When there is employment, there is quality of life.
[11990.22s - 11996.22s]:  A government only makes sense if it gives people work to improve quality of life.
[11996.22s - 11998.22s]:  Thank you, candidate Sagicela.
[11998.22s - 12004.22s]:  The first question will be answered in 15 seconds by candidate Pedro Granja.
[12004.22s - 12008.22s]:  You have proposed to keep the IBA at 15%.
[12008.22s - 12010.22s]:  Do you have any idea what that means?
[12010.22s - 12017.22s]:  We are proposing to reduce it to 10% because the IBA is a consumer tax that affects the poorest people.
[12018.22s - 12021.22s]:  Candidate Iván Sagicela, 30 seconds for your answer.
[12021.22s - 12022.22s]:  Of course.
[12022.22s - 12026.22s]:  Maybe you have no idea what investment is about.
[12026.22s - 12029.22s]:  We are proposing to keep the IBA at 1%.
[12029.22s - 12031.22s]:  For what? For credit.
[12031.22s - 12032.22s]:  I will explain.
[12032.22s - 12034.22s]:  The tax is an arithmetic matter.
[12034.22s - 12036.22s]:  If you raise taxes, more money comes.
[12036.22s - 12038.22s]:  If you lower taxes, there is less.
[12038.22s - 12039.22s]:  No.
[12039.22s - 12041.22s]:  What it is about is investing.
[12041.22s - 12045.22s]:  My economic policy for families, for small and medium-sized companies.
[12045.22s - 12050.22s]:  That is truly economic policy and at the same time social.
[12050.22s - 12052.22s]:  I hope I have answered.
[12052.22s - 12057.22s]:  The second question will be answered by candidate Luisa González.
[12057.22s - 12059.22s]:  Candidate Iván Sagicela has 15 seconds.
[12059.22s - 12061.22s]:  Candidate González.
[12061.22s - 12066.22s]:  Our police and military send you to the streets like cannon fodder without any donation.
[12066.22s - 12071.22s]:  We have to improve social security, tax home, equipment.
[12071.22s - 12076.22s]:  Apart from this, what do you propose to combat criminals?
[12076.22s - 12078.22s]:  Thank you candidate González.
[12078.22s - 12080.22s]:  Candidate Iván Sagicela has 30 seconds.
[12080.22s - 12084.22s]:  We propose that corruption be fought at all levels.
[12084.22s - 12086.22s]:  I have already demonstrated it.
[12086.22s - 12092.22s]:  I condemned Pauli, his son, Perot Delgado, the Alvarado brothers and so many others.
[12092.22s - 12097.22s]:  But we have to fight with corrupt prosecutors and judges and all officials.
[12097.22s - 12098.22s]:  First, ethics.
[12098.22s - 12100.22s]:  First, honesty.
[12100.22s - 12103.22s]:  Because people reproach corrupt politicians.
[12103.22s - 12106.22s]:  That is why there is an alternative here.
[12106.22s - 12109.22s]:  Iván Sagicela, 20 out of 20.
[12109.22s - 12113.22s]:  We continue with this debate, obligatory presidential 2025.
[12113.22s - 12118.22s]:  We meet, we remind you, with the second strip of candidates for the presidency of the republic.
[12118.22s - 12123.22s]:  Now it is the turn of candidate Leonidas Isa to answer the question in 90 seconds.
[12123.22s - 12130.22s]:  In 90 seconds, the question that Ecuador says closes 2024 with a fiscal deficit of around 4 billion dollars.
[12130.22s - 12137.22s]:  To solve this deficit, will you reduce expenses and subsidies or increase debt and taxes?
[12137.22s - 12139.22s]:  Your 90 seconds start now.
[12139.22s - 12142.22s]:  Here we talk about economic growth.
[12142.22s - 12144.22s]:  Who?
[12144.22s - 12145.22s]:  For few.
[12145.22s - 12147.22s]:  In our government it will be for all.
[12147.22s - 12149.22s]:  Where are we going to get the money?
[12149.22s - 12154.22s]:  We are going to take the anti-corruption model of Singapore, for which we have gathered.
[12154.22s - 12158.22s]:  There we have 3 billion dollars, more than 3 billion dollars a year.
[12158.22s - 12163.22s]:  7,500 million dollars goes in tax evasion to the head of the Novoa group.
[12163.22s - 12165.22s]:  Where else are we going to get the money?
[12165.22s - 12168.22s]:  Cleaning the corruption of all public companies.
[12168.22s - 12172.22s]:  We are going to repotentiate so that the money comes fresh for the state.
[12172.22s - 12173.22s]:  What else are we going to do?
[12173.22s - 12175.22s]:  We are going to renegotiate debt.
[12175.22s - 12180.22s]:  We are going to negotiate debt, yes, we are going to do it, but never on the tears of our people.
[12180.22s - 12182.22s]:  And now where are we going to generate employment?
[12182.22s - 12189.22s]:  Of the more than 6 billion dollars that the state buys, more than 1,200 million dollars will go directly.
[12189.22s - 12192.22s]:  They must buy the popular and solidarity economy.
[12192.22s - 12201.22s]:  For small and medium-sized producers, credit to one digit and the debts of our farmers, we will condone up to 10,000 dollars.
[12201.22s - 12206.22s]:  Protection to national production, that the Ecuadorians earn according to their worthy work.
[12206.22s - 12209.22s]:  We are going to guarantee focused subsidies.
[12209.22s - 12211.22s]:  We are going to lower the IBA to 12%.
[12211.22s - 12216.22s]:  I prefer that the money is in the pocket of the Ecuadorians, but not concentrated in a few hands.
[12216.22s - 12221.22s]:  Not mining on a large scale, because it is water, life and food.
[12221.22s - 12229.22s]:  With our partner Katiuska Molina, we are going to prioritize the central issues that people want, not for neoliberals.
[12229.22s - 12235.22s]:  The first interpellation, in 15 seconds, will be answered by candidate Carlos Ravascal.
[12235.22s - 12244.22s]:  Candidate Isa, indigenous peoples and nationalities, like the Afro people, have been historically and traditionally abandoned.
[12244.22s - 12250.22s]:  Would you consider, as I am proposing, a reform to the law of communes?
[12250.22s - 12253.22s]:  Candidate Leonidas Isa has 30 seconds to answer.
[12254.22s - 12264.22s]:  The white, mestizo, cholo, montuvio, indigenous and Afro, especially the popular sectors, have been historically abandoned.
[12264.22s - 12270.22s]:  You don't just need a reform to the law of communes, you need to transform institutionality.
[12270.22s - 12274.22s]:  Many have said that the constitution will change.
[12274.22s - 12276.22s]:  Let's go for number 20.
[12276.22s - 12279.22s]:  Ecuador will not change, but we will change structurally.
[12279.22s - 12284.22s]:  We will install the plural and nationality as state policy.
[12284.22s - 12291.22s]:  Candidate Leonidas Isa, who will be the second interpellation in 15 seconds, is candidate Victor Arauz.
[12291.22s - 12297.22s]:  The current budget is insufficient to meet the emergency in education, security and health.
[12298.22s - 12304.22s]:  If you had to distribute 1,000 million dollars, what percentage would you assign to each sector and under what criteria?
[12304.22s - 12308.22s]:  Candidate Leonidas Isa, please answer, you have 30 seconds.
[12308.22s - 12318.22s]:  How can we say that the budget is insufficient when a third of the budget of the 35,000 million dollars is evaded and stolen?
[12318.22s - 12321.22s]:  How is it possible that we continue to think that there is no money missing?
[12321.22s - 12324.22s]:  There is no money because they do not pay and because they steal.
[12324.22s - 12333.22s]:  That is why in our government we are going to prioritize health, education, minimum conditions for employment for our people, for our young people,
[12333.22s - 12338.22s]:  in the marginalized neighborhoods that are not recruited by the mafias.
[12338.22s - 12340.22s]:  Thank you candidate Leonidas Isa.
[12340.22s - 12345.22s]:  To close this thematic axis, we consult the same question to candidate Victor Arauz.
[12345.22s - 12351.22s]:  Ecuador closes 2024 with a fiscal deficit of around 4 billion dollars.
[12351.22s - 12354.22s]:  How can we solve this deficit?
[12354.22s - 12360.22s]:  Will you reduce expenses and subsidies or increase the debt and taxes?
[12360.22s - 12362.22s]:  Candidate Arauz, you have 90 seconds.
[12362.22s - 12366.22s]:  I will do everything necessary to not affect the economy and the pockets of the Ecuadorians.
[12366.22s - 12373.22s]:  My plan to improve the economy of the country is first and most importantly to combat the insecurity that affects national and foreign investment.
[12373.22s - 12379.22s]:  I will charge all the people in Morosos who owe the state 4,500 million dollars in the sum of all these companies.
[12379.22s - 12385.22s]:  I will fight against the tax evasion that affects from 3,000 to 4,000 million dollars a year.
[12385.22s - 12387.22s]:  I will not allow them to steal from Ecuador.
[12387.22s - 12394.22s]:  I have an anti-corruption plan that will make it impossible for me to find out what they are doing if they steal money from the Ecuadorians.
[12394.22s - 12396.22s]:  I will recover the public sector.
[12396.22s - 12398.22s]:  It is an important engine for the national economy.
[12398.22s - 12403.22s]:  Construction is an engine that moves the economy in Ecuador, where many workers intervene.
[12403.22s - 12411.22s]:  I will make sure that the money in the country is definitely being dynamized and I will generate many workplaces in Ecuador.
[12411.22s - 12420.22s]:  I will create more than 50,000 direct workplaces for young people between 18 and 30 years old who will be in charge, through associations of entrepreneurs,
[12420.22s - 12429.22s]:  of maintaining and repairing absolutely all public work at the national level in each province, in each canton.
[12429.22s - 12439.22s]:  All those doctors and teachers who were separated from the health and education system will be reintegrated into their jobs and stability will be guaranteed.
[12439.22s - 12446.22s]:  Security will be integral, the benefit will be integral and we will have that better Ecuador that we all deserve.
[12446.22s - 12447.22s]:  Thank you, candidate.
[12447.22s - 12452.22s]:  The first interpellation to your answer will be made in 15 seconds by candidate Luisa González.
[12452.22s - 12458.22s]:  The middle class is indebted and more and more impoverished and affected every day.
[12458.22s - 12462.22s]:  The excessive banking, high interest rates, increase in the gas and the gas bill.
[12462.22s - 12465.22s]:  What would you do to help this sector?
[12465.22s - 12468.22s]:  Candidate Victor Arauz has 30 seconds to answer.
[12468.22s - 12475.22s]:  Most Ecuadorians live under poverty and many of them in extreme poverty.
[12475.22s - 12480.22s]:  All this that you have just commented, candidate González, we must analyze it and put it on the carpet.
[12480.22s - 12482.22s]:  We must put the case in order.
[12482.22s - 12487.22s]:  We will not do absolutely anything, I insist, that affects the pockets of the Ecuadorians.
[12487.22s - 12498.22s]:  The issue of taxes, the issue of subsidies and everything that has impoverished Ecuador will be treated in my government and everything that affects the economy of Ecuador will be reversed.
[12498.22s - 12499.22s]:  Thank you candidate Arauz.
[12499.22s - 12505.22s]:  The second interpellation to your intervention will be made by candidate Leonidas Issa by coincidence of cards.
[12505.22s - 12507.22s]:  Candidate Issa has 15 seconds.
[12508.22s - 12516.22s]:  Mr. Police, you met with Ruben Chérez and Danilo Carrera to manage an ascent to your career.
[12516.22s - 12522.22s]:  What do you say to the Ecuadorians if when they become president they become public policy?
[12522.22s - 12524.22s]:  Thank you candidate Leonidas Issa.
[12524.22s - 12527.22s]:  Candidate Victor Arauz has 30 seconds to answer.
[12527.22s - 12533.22s]:  I was ex-president and corrupt brother-in-law who had links with drug trafficking.
[12533.22s - 12534.74s]:  I was
[12534.74s - 12543.22s]:  ex-corrupt brother-in-law who was a friend of all of them and who is currently out of the diplomatic mission and who is being investigated by the DEA.
[12543.22s - 12550.22s]:  Brother-in-law is in prison, the ambassador is investigated and Mr. Lazzo will end his days in jail.
[12550.22s - 12555.22s]:  I am free here with my head held high and I will be the president of the Ecuadorians.
[12555.22s - 12556.22s]:  Thank you candidate.
[12556.22s - 12564.22s]:  We close the third axis of economic growth and generation of jobs in the framework of the presidential debate 2025.
[12564.22s - 12566.22s]:  And now we go with the final message.
[12566.22s - 12571.22s]:  We go with the final message. Each candidate will have 25 seconds for that message to the citizens.
[12571.22s - 12574.22s]:  We start with you candidate Enrique Gómez has 25 seconds.
[12574.22s - 12576.22s]:  It starts from now.
[12576.22s - 12580.22s]:  Ecuador is living a crisis at this moment.
[12580.22s - 12584.22s]:  But we cannot allow them to take away our hope.
[12584.22s - 12590.22s]:  And that is why with Ines, with Jan, we are going together to rescue the Ecuador that we all want.
[12590.22s - 12592.22s]:  I am Enrique Gómez.
[12592.22s - 12595.22s]:  Enrique Gómez.
[12595.22s - 12598.22s]:  Vote for everything 23. For the Ecuador you want.
[12598.22s - 12604.22s]:  Thank you candidate. Candidate Luisa Gonzalez has 25 seconds for her final message.
